Investor Complacency Following Fed News,"Market Moves Stocks closed slightly higher today among large-cap stock indexes. The S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all lifted toward new highs after the Fed decision left rates unchanged today. The Russell 2000 ( RUT ) small-cap index was slightly below yesterday's change, and the Russell Microcap index ( RUMIC ) was higher by one-quarter of one percent. The market had expected the Federal Open Market Comittee (FOMC) to hold interest rates unchanged; however the committee members' sentiments expressed confidence that employment conditions would remain favorable, inflation would remain low, and interest rates would likely need not change for the entire duration of 2020 (see chart of the Fed's dot-plot below). The market did not react to such news in a big way, but subtle indications suggest that more buyers may enter the market in the days to come. Odd Mix of Technology and Utility Stocks Lead after Fed The chart below shows a one-minute breakdown by sector of how stocks responded after the Fed announcement. The two sectors leading out, with just over 30 minutes to go before the market close, were technology and utilities. This unlikely pair shows how investors immediately began to place money into sectors that would gain benefits from continued low interest rates. The losers in this scenario turned out to be the stocks in the financial sector, where the businesses stand to benefit from rising interest rates or interest rate differentials. Astute investors will recognize that this is a likely clue signalling which stocks may perform well in the days and weeks ahead. Subtle Signal Found in Interest-Rate Sensitive Sectors Another indication involving the utility sector stocks seems to indicate that investors will be likely to lift stock prices higher in the next several weeks. The chart below shows a comparison of relative strength between two sectors that are typically influenced by interest-rate decisions. Utility stocks tend to fall as interest rates rise, and the basic-materials sector stocks tend to fall as inflation wanes. Comparing the relative strength of these two sectors should prove insightful. Using State Street's utility-sector index ETF ( XLU ) and comparing it with the basic-materials-sector index ETF ( XLB ), we can see an interesting pattern emerge. The chart features a five-day moving average (green line) on the comparison line in the upper panel, and the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) in the lower panel. As the green line makes a turn down, it seems to signal a rise to follow in SPY, while a turn up presages a drop. Since this line has made a double-turn down, it may be an indication that investors are preparing to move money from more conservative investments to more opportunistic trades. The Bottom Line Stocks moved slightly higher after the release of the FOMC statement today. Fed directors expressed confidence in stable market environments for the foreseeable future. Subtle indications abound that stocks may continue higher in the days and weeks to come. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Fed Decision Could Signal Turning Point in Fourth Quarter Rally,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday afternoon, as expected, while Chairman Jerome Powell told a press conference that rate cuts were done for now. The mixed news triggered an initial sell-off that was bought quickly, yielding a strong uptick into the closing bell. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted bullish outside candlesticks that reflect a modest triumph of bulls over bears. Gold surged on the news, with the headwind of lower rates taken off the table for now. This could generate an intermediate bottom for the yellow metal while setting the stage for another trend advance. Banks went in the other direction, dumping sector indices to intraday lows in a reversal that could presage tougher times for the group in coming weeks. And most importantly, bonds surged higher, signaling a potential bottom after a modest pullback off August's multi-year high. TradingView.com The SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ) topped out at $186 in 2011 after a multi-year uptrend and sold off to $100 in 2015. Price action posted a long series of lower highs between 2013 and 2018, carving a trendline that was mounted on high volume in June 2019. The subsequent uptrend stalled in August after crossing the 50% sell-off retracement, giving way to an intermediate correction that's been testing support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the past six weeks. The fund bounced at the moving average once again after the Fed decision, posting a bullish outside day that may complete the next stage of a bottoming pattern. The weekly stochastics oscillator entered a buy cycle last week, predicting relative strength that could last into year end. This tailwind may support a test at the summer high and a breakout that will face heavy resistance between $150 and $155. TradingView.com The SPDR S&P Bank ETF ( KBE ) sold off from $60 into the single digits during the 2008 economic collapse and turned higher into the new decade, carving a shallow uptrend that stalled at the .786 Fibonacci sell-off retracement level in January 2018. It completed a topping pattern at that level and broke down in October, dumping to a two-year low in December. The bounce into 2019 stalled in the mid-$40s in March, yielding three failed breakout attempts into this week's rate decision. The fund reversed at resistance for the fourth time in Wednesday's session, but greater downside is required to confirm another failed breakout attempt. The ETF is trading lower once again on Thursday morning, but sell signals will need to wait until a decline breaks the 200-week EMA at $41.75. Downside could escalate quickly if that happens, bringing the August low in the upper $30s into play. TradingView.com The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ) entered a broad rising channel after posting a new high in 2008, with 2012, 2015, and 2016 rallies ending at channel resistance. The fund mounted the 2016 high in August 2019 and reversed a few weeks later, prior to reaching that contested level. The intermediate correction into late October has been testing the breakout level through a diagonal pattern that's still in progress. The weekly stochastics oscillator is engaged in a complex sell cycle that began in early September and still hasn't crossed into the oversold zone, indicating that bears remain in charge after the Fed meeting. However, the fund posted the strongest rally in four weeks after the news, suggesting that short-term support at $137 will hold and provide a trading floor for new long positions in coming weeks. The Bottom Line Rate-sensitive instruments took notice of Chairman Powell's decision to stop rate cuts for now, with gold and bonds rallying strongly while banks sold off. This price action could signal a major turning point in the fourth quarter rally. Disclosure: The author held no positions in the aforementioned securities or their derivatives at the time of publication."
Apple Results Surprise Investors,"Market Moves Stocks pulled back mildly today as trade deal chatter turned negative. The news didn't stop investors from buying up Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) shares as the company beat estimates and raised guidance . This was no mean feat since investors had already priced in very high expectations for the company's results. Even though iPhone sales disappointed expectations, iPad sales and the sales of Apple TV subscriptions greatly exceeded what investors forecast. Apple's headlines captured most of the attention from investors after yesterday's closing bell. However, 30 minutes after Apple reported its quarterly results, a significant earnings surprise came from a company that few if any expected to make headlines. Shares of Murphy USA Inc. ( MUSA ), an Arkansas-based specialty retailer that operates a chain of gas and grocery stores located primarily in the Midwest, jumped over 24% on its latest quarterly news. It seems that this is yet another company whose surprising results came from operations conducted in this region. It may be worth considering whether there is more to this trend than a few isolated anomalies. Convenience Is Key Over the summer, consumer staples stocks surged, led by companies in the fast food and retail industry groups, while technology stocks lagged. When September's end seemed to wake up technology investors, the fast food industry stumbled. But retail stores of one kind or another have seemed to hang on to their gains. While the consumer staples sector, as tracked by State Street's SPDR Consumer Staples ETF ( XLP ), has topped 25% gains this year already, certain stocks within the sector have surpassed expectations. A comparison of some of these companies, shown in the chart below, details how McDonald's Corporation ( MCD ), Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. ( DNKN ), Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ), and The Wendy's Company ( WEN ) have done well so far but lately have been eclipsed by stocks like Dollar General ( DG ) and Murphy USA stores. These stocks cater to people in the Midwest small towns, people whose livelihoods have been revitalized by a surging economy. Is it possible that these companies are riding a wave of consumerism driven by more discretionary cash available from their customers? Read more: Apple Stock Testing All-Time High After Strong Quarter Fed Decision Could Signal Turning Point in Fourth Quarter Rally $4 Trillion ETF Industry Faces Shakeout in 'Oversaturated Market' Is the Trump Economy Trickling Down? The comparison between Dollar General shares and Murphy USA shares is not insignificant. Both of these companies surprised investors on their recent earnings reports. With MUSA shares up strongly today, both of these companies have risen 40% in the past two quarters. Notably, both of these companies share a similar customer base. Small towns throughout the rural Midwest are significantly served by these and other companies. It may be possible that the repatriation of factory jobs and other initiatives have led to a more financially empowered consumer segment in this region. Investors would do well to watch for other companies that may be reaping similar benefits. The Bottom Line Stocks closed lower as traders exhibited mild profit-taking action on trade talk news. Apple's earnings did manage to exceed the already high expectations of investors. The fact that flyover-state companies might be doing well may not be simply a coincidence. As Murphy USA shares jumped to bring them on par with the performance of Dollar General share prices, an astute observer might be tempted to wonder if there are more stock-price jumps like theirs still yet to come.

Investors Show Willingness to Take Risks,"Market Moves Markets gapped higher and stayed in a tight range to close out Monday's session. However, small- and micro-cap stocks led the way higher and closed above their respective trendlines . This could signal that investors are much more willing to take on risks than they have been in the past several months. During the month of October, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF ( IWM ) for small-cap stocks and the iShares Microcap ETF ( IWC ) for micro-cap stocks outpaced the large-cap indexes for the first time all year. Perhaps because the major U.S. stock market indexes extended their streak of calm trading days, investors are anxious to seek out gains. In what is now the seventeenth straight trading day, the S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all exhibited a downtrend in their average true range . This is often a bullish signal, but it also describes markets that are not rising as fast as they had been in previous weeks and months. When such action takes place, investors become impatient and seek out greater opportunities for growth. Douglas Dynamics Plows Higher Douglas Dynamics, Inc. ( PLOW ), a maker of truck parts and snow-plow equipment, is the best performing micro-cap stock in the top 10 holdings of the iShares Microcap ETF. The stock price is up nearly 40% in 2019. The company continues to outperform expectations, and dividend payments provide a yield of 2% per year. The company will report its earnings tomorrow (Tuesday) about 30 minutes after the market opens. Read more: How Bearish Corporate Earnings Are Broadening the Bull Market Rally Microsoft Shares Are Surging With Huge Demand Odd Lot Trading on the Rise Microsoft Moving Up in the Cloud Microsoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) cloud-services offerings have finally begun to come into their own, and investors have noticed. Shares of Microsoft have held above the resistance level they broke through after the company announced that it had won a multi-billion-dollar government contract for cloud services. Today's price action reinforced the notion that institutional sellers want to take profit, as the stock sold off mildly from the beginning of today's session to the end. The real question is whether or not the current cluster of prices above old resistance levels will be followed by a drop in prices back into the old trading range. Such price action would be a bearish signal. The Bottom Line Stocks closed higher again today despite holding a tight trading range. Small-cap and micro-cap stocks seem to be outpacing larger-cap stocks in the final quarter of the year. Among such stocks, Douglas Dynamics is a standout. Microsoft also has interesting trading dynamics, but if the stock price drops sharply, it could be a bearish signal not only for Microsoft shares but for the larger market as well.

5 Charts That Counter Bearish Headlines,"Glass half full or half empty? Maybe the answer lies in sleep. Did you know that, if you sleep on your left side, you are more likely to have nightmares than if you sleep on your right? According to some studies published on the subject , your physical position affects your subconscious attitudes. When it comes to opinions on the market, most people must sleep on the left and are prone to nightmares. I sleep on the right. And here's the deal: all signs point to bullishness, despite the headlines desperate to get attention. The news is trying to bring everyone down. They write catchy headlines like: ""This is why the market could be 30% lower next year,"" or something similar. We've seen so many negative and shocking headlines, but it's important to remind ourselves that the market is at all-time highs. Here's what I see: big buyers are back. And man, that's bullish. Demand for equities is driving the market higher. I can say that based on measured evidence of big money investors buying up stocks. Below is a chart put out by Mapsignals. It shows net buy/sell signals each day. A green bar means more buys than sells for a given day. Red bars are days when sells are larger than buys. As an example, 90 buys and 50 sells results in a 40 green bar. After big red sticks, look for green, which means higher prices ahead to us. www.mapsignals.com We are seeing a big imbalance in signals now for the third week in a row. The average buy-to-sell ratio has been 2.6:1 for the prior two weeks. But this past week, it was 3.5:1. That will boost our Mapsignals Big Money Index (MBMI) in the coming days. A rising MBMI (more buying than selling) usually means a higher market. The flood of money coming into stocks can be seen in a few places. Each of the yellow buy columns below represents a sector seeing unusually large buying. Notice how health care, previously unloved, is coming back and attracting capital? The slaughter of software seems to be over for now, and tech is seeing continual buying in semiconductors and hardware. Elsewhere in the sectors, every sector save consumer staples and energy saw huge buying. Industrials shot to our top sector spot with 73 buys last week. Tech was strong as mentioned. The financial sector is seeing buying in banks. But the biggest story of this past week is the 68 buy signals coming from real estate. The demand from yield -hungry investors is healthy for the market. www.mapsignals.com Energy stocks continue to be the weakest link. We saw 29 sells this past week. On the subject of semiconductors, above, we have a great setup for the semiconductor industry. Look at the chart below showing semiconductor buying vs. the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ( SMH ). Notice that, when the buy signals vanish, the SMH falls like in July 2015. Then, when the buying picks up, it's off to the races. The SMH ETF rallied 150% over the next three years. Then the buying vanished again, and the index fell, followed by another short spurt of buying. Well guess what? The buying just picked up again in a big way. www.mapsignals.com As far as the market as a whole, as usual, ""ignore the noise"" and focus on the real deal. Thankfully, the real underlying stories amid the annoying news noise corroborate the bull case. The Fed lowered its benchmark funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, as expected. This keeps pressure on the 10-year Treasury yield at 1.73%, while the S&P 500 dividend yield is 1.87%. When stocks yield more than bonds, that's bullish. Ryan Detrick, CMT, points out that the best six-month period for stocks is upon us now. This is the table for the past nearly 70 years. He also points out that the past 10 years look better: higher nine times out of ten, with 8.8% gains on average. Twitter U.S. employers added 128,000 jobs in October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its monthly jobs report. That is a strong number and helped rally shares in a positive reaction. Factory activity in China expanded at its fastest pace in more than two years in October as export orders and production rose, a private business survey showed on Friday. Seeking Alpha pointed out that there is a monstrous amount of capital on the sidelines. Money Market inflows have been climbing in 2019, with assets now totaling $3.49 trillion. Refinitiv Datastream, HORAN Capital Advisors Of S&P 500 companies, 76% beat earnings expectations and 61% beat sales (71% of companies reported as of Nov. 2). Rates are low, there's oodles of money on the sidelines, sales and earnings are working, unloved sectors are catching some juice, China is showing some much-needed signs of life, our economy is strong, and people are still bearish. This sounds like a nice bull setup to us. Maybe tonight, if you're bearish, sleep on your right side. Apparently Ernest Hemingway did too. He said ""I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?"" The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
3 Charts That Suggest Agriculture Commodities Are Headed Lower Again,"Traders of agricultural commodities have seen a strong rebound in prices over the past several months. While adverse planting conditions led to a slow start of the growing season, shifts in supply and demand estimates have some traders betting on a rebound. In the paragraphs below, we'll take a look at several charts from across the agricultural commodity market and determine whether it is too early to bet on a reversal of the primary downtrend. Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA) When followers of technical analysis look to get a sense of a sector or market segment's overall trend, they generally turn to tools such as long-term moving averages and trendlines . The most popular fund that is used to gain a sense of a broad basket of the world's most liquid and important widely traded agricultural commodities, such as live cattle, soybeans, corn, cocoa, sugar, wheat, and coffee, is the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund ( DBA ). As you can see from the chart below, the bears have been in control of the momentum for most of the past two years. Active traders will want to note how the 200-day moving average (red line) has prevented the price from moving higher on each attempt to break above. While the gain since September is positive for bullish traders, the proximity of the descending trendline and the 200-day moving average should be enough of a warning that prices could struggle to move higher from here. Bullish traders may want to remain on the sidelines until the price is able to make several consecutive closes above the aforementioned resistance levels before betting on a significant move higher. StockCharts.com iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF (COW) Another popular exchange-traded product that is used to analyze the agriculture sector is the iShares Global Agriculture Index ETF ( COW ). Based on the pattern shown on the chart below, some bullish traders may be looking at the breakout above the descending trendline as a leading indication of a move higher. However, as described above, this long-term level of resistance is often used to gauge the direction of the major trend, and the downward slope suggests that the bears are technically in control. As discussed above, the proximity of the resistance of its 200-day moving average and major trendline should not go unnoticed, and these factors could prove to be the barriers that prevent a shift in the long-term downtrend. StockCharts.com Teucrium Soybean Fund (SOYB) One of the top holdings of the DBA ETF is a position in soybeans. Taking a look at the chart of the Teucrium Soybean Fund ( SOYB ), you can see that the price was able to move above the 200-day moving average, which stands as an anomaly compared to the rest of the sector. Before betting on a move higher, bullish traders will likely want to keep a close eye on whether the price is able to break above the psychological resistance of the $16 mark, which also happens to align with an influential horizontal trendline. StockCharts.com The Bottom Line Rising prices over the past few months have triggered a renewed interest in agricultural commodities by some traders. However, based on the patterns discussed above, it appears as though betting on a move higher from here may not be prudent and that nearby resistance levels could prevent the bulls from changing the direction of the long-term downtrend. At the time of writing, Casey Murphy did not own a position in any of the assets mentioned."
Why Market’s Split Personality Spells Big Trouble for Stocks,"Stocks are reaching new highs, but it’s not because investors are unanimously bullish. Experienced Wall Street players, including hedge funds and institutional investors, have become increasingly pessimistic while inexperienced investors have grown feverishly optimistic. Essentially it’s the smart money versus the dumb money, and when those two groups are in disagreement, it’s generally the smart money that wins out, according to a recent story in Business Insider . “Typically at extremes and directionally, the smart money tends to be right and the dumb money tends to be wrong,” says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, which has a total of $3.8 trillion in assets under management ( AUM ). Key Takeaways Stock markets are hitting record highs. Smart money investors have grown increasingly pessimistic. Dumb money investors have grown increasingly optimistic. Generally the smart money is right when the two groups diverge. What It Means for Investors There are lots of surveys indicating the sentiment of different types of investors, but Sonders says that what she’s watching is how the big institutional investors are actually positioning their money compared to individual retail investors . Sundial Capital Research’s SentimenTrader, which attempts to track both types of investors, is one of her key sources of data. Based on factors such as positions in equity index futures Sundial constructs statistics to track the sentiment of the two groups of investors, a Smart Money Confidence tracker and a Dumb Money Confidence tracker. The current relationship between those two trackers suggests that the more experienced and successful investors are growing increasingly bearish while the inexperienced ones are becoming increasingly bullish. The gap in sentiment between the two groups has been wider than it currently is at various times throughout the past decade, including late last year just before stocks went tumbling. The current confidence gap suggests inexperienced investors may be a little too optimistic. “Sentiment has started to look a little bit frothy,” said Sonders, arguing that retail investors may be ignoring the broader negative effects stemming from the U.S.–China trade war. The fall 2019 version of the Big Money Poll published by Barron’s confirms the increasingly bearish sentiment of experienced investors. According to the poll, only 27% of money managers that responded to the survey said they were bullish about the market’s prospects over the next year, which is down from 49% in the spring survey and from 56% a year ago. Indeed, the latest results show that the percentage of money managers that are bullish is at its lowest level in more than two decades. Looking Ahead As for confirmation of individual investor sentiment, the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey suggests that group has a generally neutral “outlook” for where stocks are headed. More telling is the fact that overall optimism has declined while pessimism has increased slightly since the last survey. Individual investors appear to wising up and may soon begin following the smart money. If that’s the case, stock markets could be headed south as the holiday season arrives."
3 Bargain ETFs in a Hot Market,"U.S. stocks have outperformed globally over the past several years, but for precisely that reason investors may want to start looking to foreign markets for new opportunities. The divergence in performance between U.S. and foreign markets over the recent past has made the former look extremely overvalued compared to the latter. But with a pivot towards foreign markets likely underway, international stocks and exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) look poised to outperform in the near future, according to a recent story in Barron’s . Key Takeaways U.S. markets have outperformed foreign markets over recent years. U.S. equities look overvalued compared to foreign equities. Foreign equities have made a comeback over the past year. Foreign ETFs may provide investors opportunities for outperformance. What It Means for Investors The S&P 500 has risen 52% over the past five years while the iShares MSCI All Country World Index Ex-U.S. ETF ( ACWX ) has risen just 6%. The stark contrast in performance reflects the favor U.S. equities have garnered over the past half decade as foreign markets have suffered from slower economic growth and negative interest rates. The fact that the U.S. is home to a number of large-cap secular growth stocks has also helped push its markets higher in this current low-growth climate. But those factors have also contributed to U.S. equity valuations that look rich compared to their foreign peers. A shift towards foreign equities is underway as U.S. valuations reach lofty highs and earnings growth. Meanwhile, the global economic slowdown is starting to catch up to the U.S. economy, which is beginning to be reflected in more recent stock performance. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, points out that the MSCI Europe Total Return Index has outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return Index over the past year. While the global economic slowdown does not bode well for either U.S. or foreign markets, the grim outlook has likely been mostly priced in. Markets are forward looking and have largely discounted the impacts of the U.S.–China trade war and Brexit , according to Shalett. Of course, if any of those conflicts worsen, there could be more negative fallout for equity prices across the globe. However, central banks around the world have begun shifting towards easier monetary policy, ramping up asset purchases and lowering interest rates in attempts to stimulate growth. Barring any worsening of geo-political and trade relations, those efforts should provide a tailwind for foreign markets, especially cyclical, export-oriented ones. “[T]he rate of change of deterioration and stock prices have stabilized,” says Shalett. “For us, that’s a sign that the worst may already be discounted.” One option for investors looking for exposure to foreign markets is the iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF ( EFV ), the four biggest holdings of which include, Toyota Motor Corp. ( TM ; American Depositary Receipt ), HSBC Holdings PLC ( HSBC ; ADR), BP Plc. ( BP ; ADR), and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Class A ( RDS.A ; ADR). Year to date, the fund is up 9.3% and shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio ( P/E ratio ) of 12.56 , compared to the S&P 500’s P/E ratio of 21.96 . Another option is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( IEMG ), with the following top four holdings, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sponsored ADR ( BABA ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ( TSM , American Depositary Share ), Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. The fund has risen 10.2% since the start of the year and shares trade at a P/E ratio of 13.89 . The iShares MSCI Japan ( EWJ ) is also an option for investors looking for specific exposure to Japanese equities. The funds four biggest holdings are Toyota, Sony Corporation ( SNE ; ADR), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. ( MUFG ; ADR), and SoftBank Group Corp. Year to date, the fund has gained about 17% and shares trade at a P/E ratio of 14.50 . Looking Ahead While these three international ETFs have lagged U.S. equity markets this year, their relative undervaluation amid a U.S. economy that is showing signs of slowing are likely going to provide positive tailwinds for their performance over the next year."
The 5 Most Important Lessons From the 1929 Crash That Matter Today,"The Great Stock Market Crash of 1929 was a wrenching event for investors, touching off a severe bear market that eventually sent stock prices plummeting by 89% over nearly 3 years. That crash took place in late October of 1929, and its 90th anniversary is a time to review five key lessons for investors today, as they try to prepare for the next big meltdown, according to a detailed analysis in a column in The Wall Street Journal by Jason Zweig, as outlined below. These five takeaways are: (1) "" buy and hold "" long term investing does not guarantee gains, (2) paying huge premiums for growth can be risky, (3) the next crash may come unexpectedly, (4) a crash may come even if corporate profits are rising, and (5) reaching the bottom may take much longer than most experts think. Key Takeaways The Stock Market Crash of 1929 has 5 key lessons for today. Buy and hold investing does not guarantee long term gains. Paying heavily for growth can be risky. A crash may come when it is completely unexpected. A crash may occur despite rising corporate profits. It may take years for stocks finally to hit bottom. Significance for Investors The 5 lessons are explored in more depth below. 1. Buy and hold investing is not a sure bet. Even over the course of decades, it may be a losing strategy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was the most-watched stock market barometer for many years both prior to and after the 1929 crash. From its peak in Sept. 1929 to its trough in July 1932, the Dow plunged by 89%. It took just over 25 years, to Nov. 1954, for the Dow to regain its Sept. 1929 peak. However, buy and hold investors would have been receiving dividends in the interim, so they theoretically could have recouped their losses on a total return basis some years earlier. Nonetheless, still stung by the crash, only 7% of middle class households in 1954 told a Federal Reserve survey that they preferred to invest in stocks rather than savings bonds, bank accounts, or real estate. 2. Paying big premiums for growth is risky . While the shares of many major companies had P/E ratios of about 14 to 19 times earnings at the 1929 market peak, some of the premier growth companies were much more expensive. For example, Radio Corporation of America (RCA), a high-flying tech stock in today's parlance, peaked at 73 times earnings and more than 16 times book value , valuations similar to that of Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) today. Additionally, in 1929 some investors were willing to pay huge fees to entrust their money to star investment managers. In this vein, a publication called The Magazine of Wall Street claimed that it was “reasonable” to pay between 150% and 200% more than a fund’s net asset value “if the past record of management indicates that it can average 20 percent or more.” 3. Crashes are often unforeseen. Few, if any, leading market watchers in 1929 anticipated a crash. An exception was economic forecaster Roger Babson, but he had been telling investors to dump stocks since 1926. In the interim, the Dow rose by about 150% to its 1929 peak. 4. A crash may come while profits are rising. In 1929, corporate profits were growing much faster than stock prices and, as noted above, the shares of many leading companies traded at reasonable valuations by historic standards. In 2019, however, many companies are reporting profit declines. 5. A crash may take years to bottom out. The Dow lost a cumulative 23% on Oct. 28 and Oct. 29, 1929, dates known as ""Black Monday"" and "" Black Tuesday ."" Following fierce selloffs during the previous week, by this point the Dow was down by almost 40% from its high on Sept. 3, 1929. The most eminent market watchers of the day thought that the worst was over, but, as noted above, the bear market would persist into July 1932, with yet larger declines ahead. Roger Babson finally turned bullish in late 1930 and by May 1931 he was advising investors to load up heavily on stocks. The Dow would plunge by about 70% from that point to its eventual trough in July 1932. Looking Ahead An old adage in investing is that ""trees don't grow to the sky."" The next bear market is inevitable, but when it starts, how long it lasts, and how deeply it plunges are all unknowns. Another inevitability is that pundits who predicted a crash will claim prescience, even if their timing was off by years. Roger Babson was an early pioneer in this regard."
Cured by a Cut,"Market Moves Investors expected the Fed to cut rates, so it was not surprising to hear the news that they did. What was surprising, however, was that after investors digested the news, they began steadily buying shares right up to the close. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) and the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) both closed at all-time highs as investors demonstrated their lack of fear in the face of foreign and domestic political pressures. The chart below shows, in 15-minute time intervals, how State Street's SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) traded in a range for about 30 minutes as investors absorbed the information, but then began trudging higher as investors showed their disposition to take on new risk and buy more stocks. This confirms signals that had been given in the market over the past two days showing that investors were more willing to seek investment opportunity and could begin a new upward trend in stock prices. Small-Cap Stocks Gain Steam One of the earlier indications of investor sentiment has been the surge in small-cap stocks, as shown by the comparison in the chart below. Comparing various exchange-traded funds including iShares' Russell 2000 index fund ( IWM ), Microcap index fund ( IWC ), Invesco's Nasdaq 100 tracking fund ( QQQ ), State Street's Midcap index fund ( MDY ), S&P 500 ETF, and Dow Jones Industrial index fund ( DIA ), a shift of dollars from larger-cap stocks towards smaller-cap stocks appears to be underway. This is clearly indicative of an attitude among investors that now is the time to take on new risk.

This company's shares doubled in value and then fell to half that gain in just the past six months (see chart below). Vastly outpacing the rest of the index, the company's prospects may be much improved in an environment where investors' appetite for riskier opportunities has increased. The Bottom Line Stocks hit new all-time highs at the close of the session after Fed officials announced another quarter-point rate cut. Small-cap stocks are on pace to outperform other stock-related asset classes. Among such stocks, NovoCure has had a fantastic run, but its deep pullback may spell opportunity for new investors hungry for unusual gains.

$4 Trillion ETF Industry Faces Shakeout in 'Oversaturated Market',"The $4 trillion ETF industry has enjoyed rapid growth over the past quarter century, but now is entering a period of shakeout in which smaller players that lack economies of scale are closing. Through early October, at least 90 funds have closed so far in 2019, after a record 139 closures in 2018. Meanwhile, launches of new exchange-traded products, including ETFs and ETNs , peaked in 2011, according to FactSet Research Systems data cited in a detailed report by The Wall Street Journal . “The challenge is as the industry has more and more participants it becomes harder to expand out into the marketplace,” as Michael Sapir, CEO of ETF issuer ProShares, told the Journal. “There’s a lot of roadkill out there,"" he added. ""The numbers for launches and closures suggest a stable and mature industry that has already seen its most dramatic growth but still has plenty of runway ahead of it,"" is the conclusion of a report in ETF.com . Key Takeaways ETF closures are rising, as many funds fail to reach profitable scale. The biggest ETF issuers are increasing their market share. The popularity of low-cost passive investing helps the biggest issuers. Significance for Investors The annual pace of new ETF launches peaked at over 300 in 2011, averaged less than 200 from 2012 to 2014, then rebounded to average more than 250 from 2015 to 2018. So far in 2019, the number is approaching 200. Meanwhile, closures have been increasing since 2011. The biggest competitors are becoming even more dominant. Total ETF assets grew by 90% in the five years through Aug. 2019, but 83% of that growth was captured by just 100 funds out of 2,100 (or 4.8%), per CFRA Research. Additionally, more than two-thirds of those 100 funds are managed by ETF giants BlackRock Inc. ( BLK ) and The Vanguard Group . The three biggest ETF brands are, with their assets under management (AUM) : iShares from BlackRock, $1.604 trillion, Vanguard, $1.064 trillion, and SPDRs from State Street Corp. ( STT ), $665 million, for a collective $3.333 trillion. This data is from FactSet as of Oct. 22, as reported by ETF.com . An ETF typically must reach AUM of between $50 million and $100 million within its first three to five years to become profitable, says Elisabeth Kashner, the director of ETF research at FactSet, as reported by the Journal. Moreover, new ETFs that fail to reach $50 million within their first year probably will fail. Among funds launched from 2007 to 2016 with AUM under $50 million after one year, 44% closed and another 30% never surpassed that amount. Among funds launched in 2018, more than 80% ended the year with less than $50 million. The market for U.S.-based mutual funds is much larger than that for ETFs, with about 8,000 funds and AUM of $15.4 trillion, but about 25% of those assets are passively-managed funds, per Morningstar. They also find that ETFs are gaining market share, adding about $135 billion in assets so far this year, while mutual funds have lost about $200 billion. Looking Ahead Since more than half of the approximately 2,100 exchange-traded products listed in the U.S. have AUM of less than $100 million, the pace of fund closures and industry consolidation is likely to accelerate, observes David Perlman, an ETF strategist at UBS, per the Journal. Also, as investors increasingly favor passively-managed ETFs over actively-managed funds partly, if not primarily, based on low cost, the biggest players with the largest economies of scale should become even more dominant."
New Crude Oil Demand Translates Into Consumer Optimism,"Market Moves Oil prices rose significantly even as stocks reached fresh new highs, while the price of gold edged higher and bond prices pulled back only slightly. All of these data points together imply that consumer demand is pushing prices higher in many sectors of the global economy. U.S. stock market indexes extended their streak of relatively calm trading days. For the sixteenth straight trading day, the S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all exhibited a downtrend in their average true range. This is a continuation of the bullish signal these indexes manifested last week. While investors have increased their appetite for taking risk, they appear to be looking for bargains. Perhaps the easiest place to find such bargains is in the energy sector. This sector has been beaten down, but with today's 3.62% spike in the price of crude oil (see chart below), many companies with good news are experiencing a gush of interest from investors. Crude Oil Demand Coincides With Exxon Mobil's Beat The level of inventory for crude oil jumped surprisingly this past week. The good news for the oil industry is that this created more refinery business. That wouldn't matter unless consumers were demanding more oil and gas production. Thankfully for the industry, the jump in oil prices seems to indicate that consumer demand is on the rise. Exxon Mobil Corporation ( XOM ) beat earnings largely on better-than-expected revenue from refinery operations. Analysts recognize that this is a signal of a trend in growing demand, and the timing for the company's report nicely coincided with the price jump of crude oil, giving investors the sense that their investments are well placed. This follows news from two weeks ago that oil production had increased and inventory had decreased at the same time. Today's news now gives analysts multiple indicators of growing demand for energy. Read more: Energy ETFs Surge Amid Trade Deal Breakthrough, Middle East Tensions 3 Reasons Walmart Is Beating Amazon Amid the Market's Giant Rally Avoid Dow's Energy Giants Despite Big Dividends Ford Finally Rebounds The increased demand for oil and gas apparently extends to the possibility that auto manufacturers will also experience an uptick in demand. Shares of Ford Motor Company ( F ) jumped 3.49% higher today, comparable to the gains showed by Exxon Mobil stock and crude oil prices. The car maker has had a tough road of late. Today's price action, however, may give investors hope that the share price has hit bottom and is ready for a change of trend. The Bottom Line Stocks closed at fresh highs, and oil prices surged in continuing signs of consumer demand. It was no surprise that Exxon-Mobil jumped higher, but even stocks such as General Motors Company ( GM ) and Ford moved similarly higher. The coincidence of oil prices jumping higher at the same time stocks are hitting new highs suggests that, overall, consumer demand is on the rise as well.

Financial Sector Moves Higher as Markets Grow Optimistic,"Market Moves The financial sector, considered by some to be a predictive indicator of stock price movement, has moved distinctly higher over the past three trading sessions. This price action marks a breakout that could be a significant indicator for all stocks. The financial sector, as tracked by State Street's Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ), has outpaced the S&P 500 ( SPX ) (see chart below), signifying that investors are increasing their investment activity in a variety of ways. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all ended the day nearly unchanged from the previous close and showed a similar narrow range of trading as well. Investors may be waiting for news to break regarding the U.S.-China trade talks since most of the bellwether companies have reported earnings so far. Despite this hesitation, investors haven't shown any action that resembles profit-taking. This suggests that they are growing more optimistic. Guess Who Won the Discount Broker Battle Oct. 1 came and went for most people like just any other day. For the discount brokerage industry, it may as well have been D-Day, where D stands for deep, deep discount. On that day, discount broker The Charles Schwab Corporation ( SCHW ) announced that it would no longer charge commissions on stock trades. The impact was dramatic. Until that point, trade commissions were a significant, though not the largest, revenue source for most brokers. By winning the race to zero, Schwab announced that it was fending off competition in the fintech space from companies such as Robinhood or Betterment. But in fact, the move served the broker well in better positioning itself against its more traditional competition, Fidelity (which is not publicly traded), TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ( AMTD ), E*TRADE Financial Corporation ( ETFC ), Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. ( IBKR ), and Ally Financial Inc. ( ALLY ). With the benefit of one month's hindsight, we can see how Schwab managed to convince investors that it knew what it was doing. The chart below shows that, since the announcement, things have worked out well for Schwab. Shares of Schwab have recently managed to recover and even outpace the iShares US Broker-Dealers ETF ( IAI ). Read more: Best Brokers for Roth IRAs: November 2019 5 Charts That Counter Bearish Headlines 3 US-Listed Chinese Stocks Rise on Trade Deal Comments What Comes Next for Schwab In the midst of this market-segment upheaval, the price chart for Schwab shows an interesting bit of price activity. The chart below shows how the price action has managed to create a broadening pattern over the past several months. This pattern reflects growing uncertainty and disagreement among analysts and investors about the prospects for the company. It is no surprise that this price pattern showed up in front of the announcement regarding commission changes. But since the announcement, the price action has made two swing low price points before breaking out of the broadening formation. Technical analysts recognize this as a potential reversal signal, which may imply a continued upward trend from this point forward. The Bottom Line Stocks closed nearly unchanged today even as the financial sector jumped higher for the third straight day. This bullish signal may imply that the market has room to make another upward move. The discount broker industry has shown sufficient price action to make it clear that Schwab, the company that first announced no-commission trades on stocks, knew it would hold a competitive advantage in such an environment. Schwab's shares show price action that looks distinctly bullish going forward. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Why Morgan Stanley Says the 60/40 Portfolio Is Doomed,"As U.S. stocks set new record highs, Morgan Stanley warns that returns on a traditional balanced portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds could approach 100-year lows and drop by half versus the last 20 years. ""The return outlook over the next decade is sobering--investors face a lower and flatter frontier compared to prior decades,"" Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients, as quoted by Business Insider . ""Investors will need to accept much higher volatility to eke out small incremental units of return,"" the note added. Morgan Stanley forecasts a 2.8% average annual return over the next 10 years for a 60/40 portfolio. The average has been nearly 8.0% since 1881 and about 6% over the last 20 years, after double digit annual returns reaching as high as 16% from the early 1980s to the early 2000s. Key Takeaways Morgan Stanley expects sharply lower investment returns ahead. They looked at a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. From the last 20 to the next 10 years, returns should fall by half. The next decade also should see returns near 100-year lows. Significance for Investors ""U.S. equities expected returns are dragged down by a combination of lower income return, low inflation expectations and penalties on both higher-than-average valuations and above-trend growth that cannot be sustained for the next decade,"" the note said. Additionally, in the 10 years since the financial crisis, ""risk-asset prices were sustained by extraordinary monetary policies that are in the process of being unwound,"" per a passage quoted by Bloomberg . Morgan Stanley assumes that, over the next 10 years, the S&P 500 Index will produce an average yearly return of 4.9%, while the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note will offer an average yield of 2.1%. At first bush, that implies an annual return of 3.8% for the 60/40 portfolio. However, the 10-Year T-Note currently yields slightly under 1.9%. To yield 2.1%, its price must drop by almost 10%, thus reducing the average annual total return of the portfolio by one percentage point per year over 10 years, cutting it from 3.8% to 2.8%. ""2019 equity gains have been about [valuation] multiple expansion on the heels of lower costs of capital,"" as Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer (CIO) of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management states in the current edition of The GIC Weekly from their Global Investment Committee. A different group in Morgan Stanley issued the note cited above. ""Without the tailwind of lower rates as the Fed pauses, future gains will depend on positive earnings improvements, which in turn are reliant on economic growth,"" Shalett adds. Calling profit growth ""lackluster,"" she is unimpressed by current economic data, and expects the markets to be ""directionless for months."" Looking Ahead Many leading market watchers already have been anticipating a reversion to the mean in investment returns going forward. They expect that an extended future period of subpar returns by historic standards is likely, balancing out the above-trend gains posted during the current decade-long bull market. Earlier this year, Jermey Grantham, Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments, Jim Paulsen of The Leuthold Group, and economist Robert Shiller of Yale University, also predicted sharply lower returns ahead, per a previous report . Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index has a valuation in the top 10% of its historical range, as investors fail to price in the risk of a recession that could cut stock prices by 30%, a recent study by The Leuthold Group argues."
Markets Press Higher as Gold and Bonds Show Correlation,"Market Moves Market participants responded with optimism to the latest news of U.S.-China trade talks as stock prices and interest rates closed higher today. Two asset classes showed an inverse response: gold and U.S. Treasury bond prices. While bond and gold prices, at times, have been known to show an inverse correlation with stocks, that hasn't necessarily meant these asset classes are positively correlated to each other. The chart below shows that this correlation has actually been quite strong throughout most of 2019. A comparison between iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ) and State Street's SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ) shows that, on a percentage return basis, gold and bonds have tracked each other quite well. The study below the prices on the chart shows the 30-day correlation coefficient between the two data series. This represents the fact that the indexes have a better than 50% correlation for much of the year. This is likely driven by the market's uncertainty over Fed policy throughout the year. FAANG Stocks Showing Mixed Results for the Year The so-called FAANG stocks – Facebook, Inc. ( FB ), Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ), and Google parent Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) – have dominated so much of investors' attention over the past five years that the stocks collectively outpaced the markets for much of that time. This year, it seems that things are a bit different. While Facebook and Apple shares have outpaced Invesco's Nasdaq 100 ETF ( QQQ ), the chart below shows that Alphabet, Amazon, and Netflix shares have lagged behind it – all for different reasons as it happens. This implies that investors may be showing yet more interest in branching out to find new sources of investment growth. Read more: How Liquidity Shortage is Fueling Explosive Stock Swings 3 Charts That Suggest Financials Are Headed Higher Expedia Stock in Freefall After Weak Quarter Investors Reward Google's Market Position The price chart for Alphabet stock shows that, while it has nearly kept pace with the NASDAQ 100, it is potentially doing so at the expense of a few other companies. The latest group of companies to feel a pinch is the group of companies that provide travel information online, but this phenomenon is not new. As the chart below shows, shares of Yelp Inc. ( YELP ) fell dramatically as viewers shifted usage patterns driven in part by changes to Google's review and reference systems. Now it seems that algorithmic changes to Google Travel were called out by executives at Expedia Group, Inc. ( EXPE ) and TripAdvisor, Inc. ( TRIP ). While investors like to invest in companies that do well, it becomes an interesting question to consider whether Google can maintain such practices for long without fear of competition or censure. The Bottom Line Stocks closed higher as both bond and gold prices dropped noticeably lower. The correlation between bond and gold prices may be useful for sophisticated investors to consider, but it likely shows that investors are thinking about both asset classes in the same way: as a hedge against a strongly surging stock market. FAANG stocks no longer represent a collective dominance in the market, and Google yet again demonstrates that it has a unique position of strength in the market.

SEC Proposes Rules to Restrict Shareholder Proposals,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , during its public meeting on November 5, 2019, voted 3-2 to consider amendments that would change the rule that governs the process for shareholder proposals to be included in a company’s proxy statement. This rule, Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, requires most publicly traded companies to include shareholder proposals, subject to certain ownership restrictions, in their proxy statements. These shareholder proposals have been used in a wide variety of ways over the decades since the SEC was first formed, but most recently to propose actions to mitigate climate change, change corporate governance standards, nominate candidates for corporate boards, and to restrict CEO pay. Most shareholder proposals never get to a proxy ballot. Corporate representatives spend time with those proposing these measures and see if they can negotiate changes that are satisfactory. Some are deemed irrelevant or dismissed because they interfere with a company’s ordinary business. SEC Chair Jay Clayton says the proposed amendments “would facilitate constructive engagement by long-term shareholders in a manner that would benefit all shareholders and our public capital markets.” Lisa Woll, CEO of US SIF : The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, disagrees, saying that the proposal, “transfers power to CEOs and company management at the expense of their shareholders. Investors have not sought these changes; corporate trade associations have.” US SIF’s mission is to shift investment practices towards sustainability, focusing on long-term investment and the generation of positive social and environmental impacts. How Much Stock Do You Need to Get a Proposal on the Ballot As the rule currently stands, the minimum stock ownership necessary to file a resolution at a corporation’s annual meeting is $2,000, which must be held for at least one year. This ownership level was last amended in 1999. The SEC is proposing instead that shareholders would have to own $25,000 of the target company’s stock for at least one year, a multiple of 12.5 compared to the current figure, or $15,000 for at least two years. Smaller shareholders who own at least $2,000 but less than $15,000 worth of the company’s stock would have to wait three years to file a resolution. From a practical point of view, the shareholder must own enough to prevent the value of the holding to drop below the threshold during the previous year in order to file a proposal. If the value falls below the cutoff, the waiting period starts again. The rule also has provisions for the level of support a shareholder proposal that does not garner a majority must win in order to be considered on a future ballot. The proposal changes these thresholds from 3 percent in the first year, 6 percent in the second year and 10 percent in subsequent years to 5 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent. The proposal also allows a company to exclude a proposal in future years if one that wins 25-50 percent if the support drops by 10 percent from the previous year’s level. How Big of a Problem are Shareholder Proposals? Based on the major changes proposed to this rule by the SEC, one would think that shareholder suggestions have been a huge problem for corporations. US SIF’s Woll, however, says that on average, only 13 percent of Russell 3000 companies received a shareholder proposal in any one year between 2004 and 2017. In other words, the average Russell 3000 company receives a proposal once about every 8 years. Data collected by US SIF shows that between 2016 and 2018, the largest number of shareholder proposals were related to proxy access, which includes nominations for the board of directors. Source: Sustainable Investments Institute. According to the Shareholder Rights Group, an association of investors formed in 2016 to defend shareowners rights to engage with public companies on issues related to governance and long-term value creation comprised of a number of faith-based investing and environmental action groups, “Most shareholder proposals seek to warn a company and its investors about emerging issues relevant to the firm’s long-term sustainability, and/or to improve governance, disclosure, risk management or performance.” Business Roundtable Supports the Change The Business Roundtable , a group formerly chaired by JP Morgan & Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, has been a key supporter of changing these rules. The group initially submitted a proposal to change the shareholder proposal rule in 2014. In a letter to the SEC by John A. Hayes, Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee at Business Roundtable, the current resubmission rules, “do little to protect shareholders and companies from needless expense and effort. Moreover, changes over the past decade in the proxy voting process have exacerbated the ineffectiveness of the Resubmission Rule, increasing the likelihood that companies will be required to repeatedly provide, and shareholders repeatedly review and vote on, proposals that are of no interest to a significant majority of shareholders.” In essence, the Business Roundtable believes that the ability of shareholders to submit initiatives that may require a vote causes companies to spend time and money that could be better used elsewhere. SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson's Dissent SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson's Dissent ""Whatever problems plague corporate America today, too much accountability is not one of them."" SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, who was one of the dissenting votes, said in a statement and in a conference call following the vote that though the existing rules could use some updating, the proposal as currently written is not the right path. Jackson’s staff studied the types of investor initiatives that would be removed from proxy ballots if the new rule is approved, and noted that the evidence shows that the proposed changes remove key CEO accountability measures from the ballot. “Whatever problems plague corporate America today, too much accountability is not one of them,” Jackson said. Amberjae Freeman, chief operating officer of Etho Capital , which creates public equity index strategies that deliver financial performance driven by climate efficiency, innovation, diversification, and superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) sustainability, says that the rule as originally written was designed to protect investors and to make it possible for more voices to be heard. She believes that shareholder activism is a way to balance the short-term profit focus of most publicly traded corporations with long-term value. Freeman says, “Shareholders should be able to bring up issues that could detract from long-term shareholder value.” Freeman quotes Adam Smith , who back in 1776 said in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations: “...The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the publick....The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.” Though many credit Adam Smith with defining capitalism, Freeman sees the book as a warning to keep an eye on corporate behavior in order to avoid causing damage. Changes Already Enacted Under the Radar Using Legal Bulletins Bryan McGannon, Director of Policy and Programs for US SIF, notes that the SEC has made a number of changes under the radar using staff legal bulletins. Bulletin 14k , issued on October 16, 2019, discusses which shareholder initiatives can be dismissed because they fall under the “ordinary business” exception. The examples listed in the bulletin involved climate change proposals made by shareholders, saying that one that specified specific greenhouse gas targets was considered micromanagement, but one that made a general statement about reducing carbon footprint was acceptable. “These proposals had been allowed in past years, but are now being excluded based on these recent bulletins,” McGannon says. It appears that the general climate towards shareholder involvement is getting less friendly. McGannon says that most shareholder initiatives are relatively short, and non-binding for the most part. He says that the proposal creates a tiered system of ownership, which is new, and restricts proposals to individual investors. Under the current rule, several investors could band together to attain the required ownership level. “As soon as you take away that aggregating, you’re taking away proposal filing power from religious groups and investing clubs,” McGannon says. Since the SEC’s guidance is that an investor should have diversification, an individual would need a substantial portfolio to hold $25,000 in a single position, including the buffer one would need to keep that holding from dropping below the threshold value during the year. What's Next? What’s next for this rule proposal? The entire proposal comprises over 300 pages, and once it’s published in the Federal Register, the 60-day public comment period commences. McGannon says that US SIF is pushing to extend the comment period since the document contains more than 100 questions that anyone interested can comment upon. We will update this article once the rule has been published and include a link to the comments. Once the comment period is closed, the SEC’s staff must consider all of the submissions, then write a final version of the rule. The edited rule goes back to the SEC for a vote before being enacted."
How Cannabis Cash Crunch Will Flatten Pot Stocks,"Cannabis stocks are getting crushed, creating financing problems for the companies that issue them. The North American Marijuana Index, which tracks leading cannabis stocks like Canopy Growth Corp. ( CGC ), Aurora Cannabis Inc. ( ACB ), Cronos Group Inc. ( CRON ), and Tilray Inc. ( TLRY ), has fallen 57% over the past year. Raising cash through the issuance of new shares at such low valuations is unappealing, but pot producers have limited alternatives, according to The Wall Street Journal . Key Takeaways Cannabis stocks have lost more than half their value over past year. Equity financing loses its appeal at such low valuations. Banks are reluctant to lend as pot is still federally illegal in U.S. Cash crunch comes as Canadian pot sales are expected to slow. What It Means for Investors Most publicly traded companies raise cash through a mix of both equity financing and debt financing , and debt financing is often the cheaper option. But pot producers face a problem when it comes to debt financing that is specific to their industry. Large banks don’t want to lend to them because cannabis is still federally illegal in the U.S. Dealing with potential legal headaches is one risk banks just don’t want to take. Another risk banks are reluctant to take is lending to companies whose ability to earn consistent profits is still in question. In a nascent industry like cannabis, most companies fall into that category. However, Green Thumb Industries is one cannabis firm that was fortunate to raise $105 million through a bond issuance in May. The company managed to convince creditors of its path to profitability, but offering a 12% coupon on the bond also helped. Since then, debt costs have risen. The limited ability to tap debt markets means most pot producers end up issuing new shares in order to raise cash. But that’s an option that no longer looks appealing after the obliteration of market valuations over the past year. After peaking at over $17 billion in late April of this year, Canopy Growth’s market capitalization has fallen 60% to just under $7 billion. The amount of capital being raised in the cannabis industry is falling in tandem with the drop in market values. The amount raised during the week that ended 25 October fell to just $27 million from $708 million a year ago. “The recent downturn in cannabis stocks has spilled over to the private-equity and debt markets,” Tony Cappell, co-founder of cannabis finance firm Green Ivy Capital, told the Journal . This cash crunch comes at a vulnerable time for marijuana companies as growth in pot demand in Canada, where the drug is fully legalized, starts to slow. Analysts at Stifel have cut their sales expectations for Canada’s producers by 10% to 20% for the most recent quarter that ended in September and expect next year’s sales to be lower than previously thought, according to Barron’s . That’s likely to put even more downward pressure on cannabis stocks. Looking Ahead However, the analysts suggest that investors focus on companies with large hoards of cash in this currently cash-strapped environment, including Canopy Growth and Cronos Group. While other companies will struggle to raise funds, the firms sitting on piles of cash will be the ones still able to invest in an industry that has the potential to turn into a “$200 billion global opportunity.”"
Global Investment Presents Opportunity,"Market Moves With U.S. markets stuck in narrow trading ranges, investors have shown signs that they are willing to look around for opportunity. Investors frequently neglect opportunities in markets outside their own country or region. However, right now might be a good time for U.S.-based investors to look around at which markets are showing a bullish trend within their own countries. While the S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all ended their third day in a row nearly unchanged, investors might consider looking at Taiwan-based companies. The chart below shows a year-to-date comparison of exchange traded funds from iShares that track MSCI indexes for stocks in various countries, and compares them to the iShares emerging markets ETF ( EEM ) for comparison. Although the South Korea ETF ( EWY ) has shown lackluster performance on a fallout from trade talks between the U.S. and China, other countries in the region, such as Japan ( EWJ ), Australia ( EWA ), and Taiwan ( EWT ) have outpaced the S&P 500 so far this year. Health Care Stocks Are Becoming More Attractive Health care stocks have lagged behind all other market sectors for 2019 except the energy sector. However, over the past month, these stocks have begun to rise faster than average to bring the sector into a position more competitive with other sectors in the market. The chart below shows how State Street's health care sector-tracking ETF ( XLV ) moved from its short-term position in October as the sector with the lowest returns to being nearly on par with State Street's S&P 500-tracking ETF ( SPY ). Surprisingly, this is happening without the leadership of the most heavily represented stocks in the sector. Read more: Why Morgan Stanley Says the 60/40 Portfolio Is Doomed How $3.4 Trillion in Sideline Cash will Boost Markets Why Goldman Says Go 'Overweight' U.S. With Stocks at Record Levels Medtronic Outpacing Other Health Care Stocks The price chart for Medtronic plc ( MDT ) shows that it has moved higher than the average stock in the health care sector. In fact, four out of the five largest holdings in the health care sector ETV (XLV) are showing lower returns than XLV on a year-to-date basis. Only Medtronic, the fifth largest holding in the ETF, is outpacing the average. If this sector surges higher in the near future, it seems a good bet that Medtronic stock will lead the way. The Bottom Line Stocks closed nearly unchanged for the third day in a row. Global investment opportunities appear to be available in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and Germany. The health care sector has had a slow start for the year but may have a nice finish since investors are optimistic and the stocks in that sector are comparatively undervalued. Among these stocks, Medtronic is positioned to be a leader. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
The Hidden $7.7 Trillion Catalyst That's Fueling U.S. Stocks,"While Wall Street tends to focus almost exclusively on the attitudes and trading patterns of U.S.-based investors, a surge of buying from overseas has been an overlooked source of strength for U.S. stock prices. Holdings of U.S. equities by foreign private investors reached a record high of $7.7 trillion in July, more than double the amount in 2012, according to the most recent data compiled by the U.S. Treasury Department , as cited by The Wall Street Journal in a detailed report summarized below. “What’s happened in the last 10 years is that high returns have also been associated with the safety that comes with the U.S.,” observes Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions for Asia-Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “Usually when you think of safety, you equate that with low returns. But that hasn’t been the case,” he added. Specifically, the S&P 500 Index has outperformed non-U.S. stocks in 9 of the past 10 years, including 2019. Key Takeaways Holdings of U.S. stocks by foreign private investors are at a record. The U.S. stock market is offering them better returns and less risk. U.S. stocks have beaten overseas stocks handily in the last decade. Future growth prospects are also more robust in the U.S. Significance for Investors “You’re seeing a real divergence between growth prospects in the U.S. equity market and the rest of the world,” according to Hannah Anderson, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. Right now, despite high valuations , U.S. stocks remain attractive to foreign investors based on better projected GDP growth than other developed economies, a strong labor market, and robust consumer spending . The consensus among analysts calls for 9.7% growth in EPS for the S&P 500 in 2020, per data from FactSet Research Systems. The comparable figures for major overseas indices are 8.6% for the STOXX 600 in Europe and just 2.6% for the Nikkei 225 in Japan. After the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. economy and banking system staged a much faster rebound than Europe. Indeed, since the crisis, U.S. banks have become increasingly dominant internationally, while their smaller and less profitable European rivals have become less competitive and forced to retreat from the U.S. market, per another report in the Journal . Meanwhile, Japan has been mired in decades of economic stagnation, with no end in sight. Additionally, the U.S. has led the technology boom that is changing the world economic landscape, including financial markets. Moreover, U.S.-based giant tech companies, such those in the so-called FAAMG group, are both the tech leaders worldwide and among the largest and most influential corporations within the U.S. itself. As a result of all this, foreign private investors should continue to be net buyers of U.S. equities, giving the U.S. market added upward impetus. Moreover, the $7.7 trillion figure cited above does not include the holdings of sovereign wealth funds and central banks . As a result, total international holdings of U.S. stocks, and potential future purchases thereof, are probably significantly greater. Real estate is an example of a countervailing trend, as foreign investors were net sellers of U.S. commercial properties in Q2 2019, per another Journal article. This was the first quarter since 2013 in which they were net sellers. However, in reducing their net exposure to U.S. commercial real estate by $0.8 billion in the quarter, these investors appear to have been freeing up funds for redeployment into U.S. stocks and bonds, where foreign buying has been brisk. Looking Ahead Another source of demand for U.S. stocks comes from U.S.-based investors who are shunning international equities, concerned about geopolitical tensions and slower growth abroad. “People just don’t want as much foreign stocks than they used to,” as financial advisor Scott Hanson told CNBC . “I think a lot of people are questioning what’s the point of taking that risk,” he added. A potential longer-term negative for the U.S. economy is declining foreign direct investment . After reaching a high of $440 billion in 2015, it fell sharply in 2016 and 2017, before recovering partially to $296 billion in 2018, 38% below the 2015 peak, per CNN . Not surprisingly, the biggest drop has been in investment from China."
"U.S., China Will Cancel Tariffs in Stages: China's Commerce Ministry","Global markets were lifted by news that the U.S. and China will rollback additional tariffs in stages as they work toward a ""phase one"" deal. At a press conference reported on by the state-owned Global Times, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said the two countries canceling tariffs imposed on each other during the trade war is an important condition for any agreement between them. He added that this will ""help stabilize market expectations, benefit the economies of the two countries and the world economy, and benefit producers and consumers."" The number of tariffs removed will be negotiated, and there was no timeline provided. The decision comes after two weeks of constructive discussions between the two leaders where core concerns were resolved, according to Feng. The state-owned Xinhua News Agency also reported this morning that China is contemplating lifting restrictions on poultry imports from the U.S. put in place after the 2015 bird flu outbreak in the U.S.. U.S. tariffs cost China $35 billion in the first half of 2019, according to a new report from UN trade agency, UNCTAD. The hardest-hit Chinese manufacturing sector has been computers and other office machinery, and communications equipment, where exports have declined by $15 billion, according to the press release . Sixty-three percent of China's export losses was diverted to other competitors including Taiwan, Mexico, the European Union and Vietnam. The following chart from UNCTAD displays the evolution of the trade war that began in 2018. Evolution of U.S. China Trade War. UNCTAD Today's developments come as a ray of hope to investors thinking there is no end in sight for the trade dispute that hurts both economies. Dow futures rose over 140 points and Europe's STOXX 600 index jumped to its highest point in over four years. According to a previous Reuters report, Chinese officials have been pushing for all U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods to be dropped ""as soon as possible."" Reuters added that a deal could be signed next month by the presidents of the two countries at a yet-to-be-determined location."
Low Volatility Could Be a Bullish Indicator,"Market Moves If it is true that bullish markets are less volatile than bearish or sideways markets, then it is worth considering whether the unusually low volatility in the market indexes over the past week is a forecast of a continued upward trend in U.S stock markets. If so, then the fact that this low volatility has occurred as the S&P 500 index ( SPX ) reached new historic highs is not coincidental. The chart below reviews a weekly look at State Street's SPDR S&P 500 Index tracking ETF ( SPY ). Shown below the price chart is a study that tracks a 10-week average true range. This version of the study is measured as a percentage of the current price of SPY. The study shows that the difference between the high and the low prices in the past week was unusually narrow, so much so that only a handful of weeks in the past two years traded in such a tight range. In 2017, this range was actually fairly common, though still on the lower half of trading ranges. That was the last significantly bullish year for the index. Coming now one week after the market broke into new high territory, it may be that this is an indication of a low-volatility upward trend. This kind of trend is similar to earlier years in this decade, and if such a trend were beginning to take shape right now, investors would be wise to consider whether it could last into 2020. Trading Range on the 10-Year Treasury Note Is Troubling One interesting indication that could actually help to push stock market indexes higher might simply be a flight out of bond funds fueled by rising interest rates. Interest rates (or yields) are inversely correlated with bond prices. So if interest rates are going to rise, the bond prices are going to fall. This is bad news for those who have their money in fixed-income funds that track bond prices such as iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ). On the other hand, it is good news for the stock market in general, since money coming out of bond funds will look for a place to go. Typically, investors moving their money out of bonds are likely to move their money to stocks as an alternative. Such a dynamic taking place through the end of the year could fuel another stock market rally. The chart below shows why this dynamic could play out. The level of volatility in interest rate changes over the past three months, as tracked by the average true range on the 10-year Treasury Note ( TNX ), is consistent with times in the past several years where interest rates have risen for the following year. Read more: 5 Lessons From WeWork’s $40 Billion Meltdown Fox Corporation Broadcasts Upbeat Quarterly Earnings Disney Stock Rallies to 3-Month High After Strong Quarter Auto Parts Manufacturers Should Be Wary A small company in the auto parts manufacturers industry group reported disappointing earnings today as its stock dropped by over 40%. Shares of Modine Manufacturing Company ( MOD ) fell as the company announced its sales for HVAC-related products were disappointing and would likely influence company results for the next quarter. Perhaps this is an isolated event in this industry; however, the chart below depicts the fact that price action for Modine shares were highly correlated to the movements of a portfolio of the top five stocks in this industry group. These stocks include Johnson Controls International plc ( JCI ), BorgWarner Inc. ( BWA ), LKQ Corporation ( LKQ ), Aptiv PLC ( APTV ), and Lear Corporation ( LEA ). The important question for these companies, not to mention their investors, to consider is whether today's results are an indication of a larger trend at play among consumers. The Bottom Line Stocks closed the week with a very tight range, so tight that it is in the lowest 5% of such results for the past two years. The lower volatility may be a bullish indication. Volatility patterns on TNX may also corroborate this idea, as it forecasts reduced bond prices, which could drive investors out of bonds and into stocks. Meanwhile, increased volatility among one of the smaller companies in the auto parts industry could signal trouble ahead for the rest of the group.

7 Stocks Poised to Rise as Market Enters Best Stretch in 8 Decades,"The period from November through January historically has been the best three-month stretch for stocks since 1936, according to analysis by Bank of America Merrill Lynch cited in a recent report by Business Insider . Tax-motivated selling by mutual funds and other investors drive this seasonal pattern. Meanwhile, strategists at BofAML have identified 16 stocks with solid fundamentals . that should rebound after tax-motivated selling. Here are 7 of them: CBS Corp. ( CBS ), Viacom Inc. ( VIAB ), Centene Corp. ( CNC ), DuPont de Nemours Inc. ( DD ), F5 Networks Inc. ( FFIV ), Kroger Co. ( KR ), and DXC Technology Co. ( DXC ). Key Takeaways The best 3-month period for stock gains is November-January. This is based on history from 1936 onwards. Tax loss selling by mutual funds and other investors create bargains. Significance for Investors Based on data since 1936, BofAML finds that the S&P 500 Index posts an average total return , dividends included, of 4.4% in the three month period from November through January. The average total return for any other three-month period is 2.9%. BofAML looked at 12 different periods, each with a different set of three consecutive months. BofAML attributes their finding to the fact that mutual funds must sell a stock by Oct. 31 to recognize a capital loss for tax purposes during the same calendar year. After that deadline passes, such stocks often recover. Additionally, other investors engage in tax loss selling, or tax loss harvesting , late in the year. This depresses the prices of losing stocks yet more, often creating bargains that rebound in January. Media companies CBS and Viacom are slated to merge, and both are valued cheaply, with forward P/E ratios less than 7x projected next 12 month earnings. Both also are down by more than 12% year-to-date. Their cheap valuations and sinking stock prices suggest low expectations about future growth, with the combined company lagging in the increasingly competitive video streaming market, according to Barron's . Grocery chain Kroger has been losing market share to Walmart Inc. ( WMT ), but the stock bounced by 11.4% on Nov. 5 based on profit guidance for its fiscal year 2020 that exceeds consensus estimates. After retreating by 3% on Nov. 6, its share price is virtually unchanged in 2019, with a forward P/E under 12x. For fiscal 2020, Kroger projects same store sales , excluding fuel, to grow by 2.25%, free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, outlays of $500 million to $1 billion on share repurchases , and significant growth in ""alternative profit businesses,"" per Zacks Equity Research. Beyond fiscal 2020, the company forecasts annual earnings growth of 3% to 5% and strong FCF that generate annual total returns to shareholders between 8% and 11%. The ""Restock Kroger"" program is designed to produce operational efficiencies while also giving consumers greater choice and better service at lower prices. A previous report presented 10 other stocks that may benefit from tax loss selling, plus year-end window dressing by fund managers. Veteran market watcher Mark Hulbert , using data from 1926 onwards, found that a hypothetical portfolio of the worst-performing 10% of stocks during the prior 12 months, rebalanced monthly, delivered, on average, monthly losses in Q4, but significant monthly gains in Q1. Looking Ahead While history indicates that tax loss selling can create bargains, past performance does not guarantee future results. Also, Hulbert warns that ""it’s important to be choosy and not indiscriminately buy just any stock that has performed dismally."" Like BofAML, he also applies additional analysis to select beaten-down stocks with attractive fundamentals."
Gold ETFs Approach Support After Sell-Off,"Ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, along with geopolitical tension in the Middle East, have underpinned gold prices throughout most of 2019. Furthermore, a weakening U.S. dollar this year brought about by three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts has helped support the precious metal, as the two assets typically have an inverse correlation. However, the commodity opens this week fresh off its biggest five-day fall since May 2017 – down roughly 3%, after reports emerged last Thursday that Washington and Bejing had agreed to roll back tariffs on each others' goods if the first phase of a trade deal is agreed upon by both countries. While the yellow metal initially sold off after the news surfaced, the move may be short lived after President Donald Trump cautioned Friday that he had not approved the deal negotiated between U.S. and Chinese officials. ""China would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback, 'cause they know I won’t do it,"" Trump said, as reported by Reuters . ""I haven't agreed to anything,"" the president added. Moreover, with stock market valuations becoming lofty, any pullback in sentiment may see risk-on assets come under selling pressure, helping gold prices regain their luster. From a technical standpoint, the three gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outlined below have formed chart patterns that indicate prices may be about to resume their long-term uptrend. Below, we review the metrics of each fund and put forward some alluring trading ideas. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) Launched in 2004, the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) invests directly in physical gold by holding the commodity in London vaults, offering investors and traders a vanilla-like product for following the precious metal's spot price performance. A daily trading volume of roughly 9 million shares, coupled with an average spread of just 0.01%, makes the fund suitable for both long- and short-term strategies. As of Nov. 11, 2019, GLD controls an enormous asset base of $44.46 billion, charges a 0.40% annual management fee, and has returned nearly 20% year to date (YTD). Since rising 22% between May and August, GLD shares have tracked lower within an orderly descending channel . If last week's steep pullback continues in subsequent trading sessions and the relative strength index (RSI) moves into oversold territory, look for an entry point toward the pattern's lower trendline at the $136 level. Once in a trade, consider setting a profit target near the channel's top trendline at $142 and placing a stop-loss order about $2.50 below the execution price. Before committing capital, traders may decide to wait for price action to show signs of a reversal, such as the print of a hammer or piercing candlestick pattern. StockCharts.com VelocityShares 3x Long Gold ETN (UGLD) The VelocityShares 3x Long Gold ETN ( UGLD ) aims to deliver three times the daily investment results of the S&P GSCI Gold Index ER, making the fund a cost-effective product for those who want to take a geared bullish bet on gold prices. Traders should, however, be aware that returns greater than one day may deviate from the advertised leverage due to the effect of compounding . More than 130,000 shares change hands daily, providing ample liquidity for active traders. However, the ETN's average spread of 0.06% may be slightly too wide to book minuscule scalping profits. The fund charges an expensive 1.35% management fee, although this is less important given its short-term tactical mission. UGLD has assets under management (AUM) of $191.04 million and sports a YTD return of 35.42% as of Nov. 11, 2019. The UGLD share price has also carved out a descending channel over the past three months to create high-probability support and resistance zones for actioning trades. Those looking to buy the fund should think about setting a limit order close to the pattern's bottom trendline at the $124 level. In terms of trade management, consider placing a stop order somewhere below $118 and targeting a move up to $140, where price may encounter selling pressure from the channel's upper trendline and 50-day simple moving average (SMA). StockCharts.com Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NUGT) With net assets of $1.58 billion, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares ( NUGT ) has an objective to return three times the daily performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. The tracked benchmark comprises global gold and silver mining firms that operate in both developed and emerging markets. Its top two holdings – Colorado-based Newmont Goldcorp Corporation ( NEM ) and Canadian gold mining giant Barrick Gold Corporation ( GOLD ) – carry a cumulative weighting of about 22%. Due to the ETF's use of derivative instruments to achieve leveraged returns, its expense ratio of 1.35% isn't cheap. More importantly, dollar volume liquidity of more than $335 million most days, combined with an average two-cents spread, keep trading costs minimized. As of Nov. 11, 2019, NUGT issues a dividend yield of 0.35% and has gained 50% on the year. After setting a 52-week high just above $45 in early September, NUGT shares have retraced within a textbook falling wedge pattern. As global financial markets moved into ""risk-on"" mode last week, the ETF's price tumbled toward a confluence of support from the bullish chart pattern's lower trendline and 200-day SMA. Those who buy at current levels should anticipate an upside reversal, with a possible test of the previously mentioned 12-month high at $45.10. Manage risk by positioning a stop order just below $24 and raising it to the breakeven point if price climbs above 50-day SMA. StockCharts.com"
ETF Buying Is Huge Right Now – What's Next?,"Hockey is my favorite sport. I still enjoy football strategy, soccer drama, basketball high scores, and baseball stats. Watching hockey is amazing but can be hard because it's so fast. Bobby Hull shot the fastest puck in recorded history at 118.3 miles per hour. Imagine a one-third of a pound of frozen hard rubber whizzing right at your face at more than 100 mph. That helps explain the lack of teeth in the sport: actual teeth. Hockey action never stops, even when the whistle blows. But don't just watch the player with the puck – watch as much of the ice as you can. Sometimes, everyone rushes for the puck at once. Other times, players set up in a systematic way to execute plays. The past couple of weeks show why the current market is more like everyone rushing for the puck at the same time. The stock market is almost like all sports combined. And just like sports, there are endless subtle nuances to pick up on. I pay attention to big money moving in and out of stocks.  It dictates play and direction. Sometimes, it might be a lone hedge fund affecting a single stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF). When the big money wants to buy more shares than available, the price goes up. Other times, big money moves together en-masse . ETFs are the best example. Along with tracking 5,500 stocks per day for big buying and selling, I also track thousands of ETFs too. (I don't sleep much.) I've written a series of three white papers on how ETFs have grown from novelty in the early 1990s to the main event now. Financial advisors morphed into asset gatherers rather than asset managers, making ETFs the main weapon of choice in adding or reducing equity exposure. The ETF series of white papers can be found here: Sharks, High Frequency, and ETFs The Evolution and Mutation of ETF Sharks Since October 2016 ETF Doom-Sharks: What Really Caused the Meltdown in 2018? But you don’t need to read the 65-plus pages I've written about it. Here, I summarize it for you in two simple charts. The first chart shows that, when there's sustained buying in ETFs, it pushes the market higher. Continual buying is the gas on the bull-fire. But when it vanishes, the market goes soft. It's very clear from this that big ETF inflows have a lot to do with market rallies. www.mapsignals.com The second chart shows what really happens in that vacuum of buying. If it's accompanied by dumping of ETFs, guess what? The market falls quickly. www.mapsignals.com This seems obvious, but it's not often discussed. I tell you this because last week saw the biggest ETF buying since the week of March 15. Since many ETFs are a collection of stocks, we could assume that last week saw serious buying in stocks. The yellow numbers mean above average buying in that sector. As you can see, it was major buying nearly across the board. There were three notable exceptions: real estate, energy, and utilities … they all were sold. But industrials, financials, and materials saw massive buying. Tech, discretionary, and health care also felt the juice. Even telecom and staples found love. This is clear risk on, and notice the headlines? The market is strong right in the face of impeachment. www.mapsignals.com What does buying like this mean going forward? Looking back at similar setups, we saw two recent times, but with different characteristics. Nov. 28, 2017, to Dec. 4, 2017: Buying was big for five days. The Big Money Index was just starting to rise from 65% to 69%: nowhere near overbought. Remember, overbought is when 80% of all signals are buys vs. sells on a 25-day moving average. The S&P 500 rose less than 1%, and then buying cooled off after the five-day run. Jan. 2, 2018, to Jan. 26, 2018: Buying was big for 18 straight days. The Big Money Index went from 77% to 82% (80% and above is extremely overbought). The S&P 500 rose 6.5% over those 18 days, then plummeted. This chart shows the start dates when a five-plus day stretch of big buying started: How does today compare to those two examples above? Today's buying looks like scenario number one for two reasons: The Big Money Index surged from 58% to 66% over the past five days. That is similar to Nov. 2017 (not overbought, just starting to rise). The S&P 500 rallied less than 1% in the past five days. Here’s the deal: The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ are all at highs. Sustained buying won't last forever, but I do expect more buying to come in order to get us to overbought. Enjoy the ride if you are long – but have a game plane for once/if we get overbought. If you are on the sidelines, I would recommend staying put. Pullbacks are opportunities, and they will come. The bottom line: ""Don’t chase a raging bull."" The time to buy was weeks ago. This is what I said in mid-October when I said that the bulls are ready to run. The important thing is to tame fear of ""when will the market correct?"" Justine Musk put it nicely: ""Fear is a powerful beast. But we can learn to ride it."" The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
Why Investors Are Buying Beaten Up Assets,"Investors are bidding up previously underperforming asset classes, such as commodities, currencies, cyclical stocks , and emerging market stocks. The bargain hunters are betting that the global economy is bottoming out, based on signs that the U.S. and China are finally resolving their trade conflict, stimulative interest rate cuts by major central banks , and rising hopes for an orderly Brexit , per a detailed report in The Wall Street Journal summarized below. “We think it’s time to deploy money into markets broadly,” says Olivier Marciot, senior vice president at investment management firm Unigestion. “It’s like a baby Goldilocks environment ,"" he added, referring to solid economic growth, low inflation, and low interest rates. Key Takeaways A variety of previously underperforming assets have been surging. Optimism about trade and economic growth has driven buying. However, injections of liquidity by central banks are another factor. Significance for Investors Candice Bangsund, a portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, is another optimist. “There are some early indications that the worst may be behind us and the global economy is finding a floor,” she said. She is encouraged by a three-month upswing in the JPMorgan Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, and by reported progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. The British pound has risen by more than 6% from recent multiyear lows, and a variety of currencies are up in tandem with a rebounding Chinese yuan. Emerging market stocks had a steep selloff earlier this year, but have recovered since then. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( EEM ) dropped by 13.6% from a high in April to a low in August, but is up by 12.0% since then. Among commodities, there has been a broad rally including oil, copper, and coffee, to name a few. Another indicator of increased bullishness about the economy is a rising yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note . From a low of 1.43% on Sept. 3, it closed at 1.92% on Nov. 11. Other safe haven assets that were up earlier in the year, such as gold and the Japanese yen, also are down recently. Cyclical U.S. stocks are seeing increased demand from investors, and have outperformed recently. For Q3 2019 through Nov. 11, the S&P 500 industrial sector is up by 5.20% and the S&P 500 financial sector has gained 5.94%, versus a 3.70% increase for the entire S&P 500 Index, per S&P Dow Jones Indices . Bank stocks also should benefit going forward from revived investor interest in value stocks , Barron's reports. Despite being vastly healthier than they were prior to the 20o8 financial crisis, their valuations are still much lower than they were back then, even after enjoying recent boosts to profits from tax reform and deregulation. The forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 financial sector was 12.6 times projected next 12 months' earnings, versus 17.5 times for the full index, making it cheapest of the sectors, per I/B/E/S data by Refinitiv as of Nov. 6 and reported by Yardeni Research . Looking Ahead Morgan Stanley remains a leading pessimist among major investment firms. ""We lean defensive as we expect pressure on earnings,"" according to their current Weekly Warm Up report. Regarding recent ""excitement"" about rebounding purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) , they believe that ""the rebound may already be fully priced."" They also warn that, rather than being ""a definitively bullish signal on future growth,"" much of the recent rally in asset prices actually may have been ""due to excess liquidity provisions from the Fed and ECB in particular."""
Home Sweet Home,"Market Moves The 10-year Treasury Note Index ( TNX ) fell slightly in today's trading session. This is good news for prospective home buyers and homebuilders alike because lower rates increase purchasing power and make homes more affordable. While some indications suggest that interest rates may rise, perhaps interest rates won't matter so much since they are near historic lows anyway. After all, the homebuilding industry may be entering what is thought to be the best season of the year for those companies' stocks. While the S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) were little changed for the day, bond prices moved higher by 0.65% (corresponding to the drop in interest rates). So far this year, the home building industry has benefited from the downward trend in rates this year. The chart below shows that the industry has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 for the year so far. Stocks in the industry group are up over 50% on average. Homebuilder Stocks Maintain Lead over Market Averages Shares for home builder Meritage Homes Corporation ( MTH ) have already doubled their price so far this year. They represent the highest performance from the six largest holdings in the State Street;s SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ( XHB ). The other five stocks include KB Home ( KBH ), D.R. Horton, Inc. ( DHI ), Pulte Home ( PHM ), Lennar Corporation ( LEN ), and Toll Brothers, Inc. ( TOL ). Five companies in this group have surpassed earnings expectations in their recent quarter reports. The remaining one, Toll Brothers, is scheduled to report earnings Dec. 9.

Horton Still Beating Expectations Shares of D.R. Horton jumped yesterday and maintained their position in today's trading. D.R. Horton is the largest company in the homebuilder sector by market capitalization and beat analyst expectations in its last earnings report, sending the stock to new all-time highs. This company managed to increase sales, increase profit, and hold expenses even while returning an industry group best of 17% return on equity . If the biggest company in this space is capable of increasing all its metrics, then it is likely that other companies in the space still have room to grow as well. The Bottom Line For the 21st day in a row, the S&P 500 traded within a below-average sized range. This long streak of decreasing volatility puts the stock market in such a state that the change in interest rates and bond markets is larger by comparison, even as the 10-year note fell slightly today. Low interest rates have helped homebuilder stocks gain anywhere from 50% to 100% on the year. Even the biggest company in the group D.R. Horton managed to improve all of its metrics this year.

5 Warning Signs of Market 'Euphoria',"The U.S. stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, is up 23.4% this year and recently reached a new record high, but five signs of investor euphoria suggest growing risks, according to Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. She endorses RBC's year-end 2019 target of 2,950 for the index, 4.7% below the Nov. 12 close, according to a recent story in Barron's . Calvasina discussed these five signs in a note to clients: Asset managers have bullish positions in U.S. equity futures similar to the highs before the financial crisis, risking a big negative reaction to bad news. U.S. stock valuations are near their late 2017 highs. Earnings forecasts for 2020 are too optimistic. Stock prices anticipate a phase one U.S.-China trade agreement, but business confidence remains seriously damaged. The S&P 500 has risen nearly 32% above its Dec. 2018 low, similar to previous rallies off lows in 2010, 2011 and 2016 that paused. Significance for Investors ""We haven’t learned anything in the current reporting season that justifies euphoric positioning and peak valuations,"" Calvasina wrote. ""Reporting season has been better than feared, but the overall tone around demand/macro, tariffs and cost savings all sounds very familiar--it’s what companies have been saying all year,"" she added. On the other hand, money market fund assets are $3.4 trillion, a 10-year high and still rising, undercutting the ""euphoric positioning"" narrative. Several strategists see this as a bullish indicator, per The Wall Street Journal . Calvasina predicts that a pause by the Fed in cutting interest rates limits the upside for equity valuations. If 2020 earnings disappoint, as she anticipates, stock prices should sink. ""Everyone is too positive,"" as Pilar Gomez-Bravo, director of fixed income at MFS Investment Management, told the Financial Times . She observed that investors ""still prefer overall to bid up already expensive quality names than venture into more challenged ones."" However, CEOs and CFOs are not positive, reflecting damaged business confidence. CEOs are more pessimistic than at any prior time since the financial crisis of 2008, and 67% of CFOs at large U.S. corporations expect a U.S. recession in 2020, Goldman Sachs observes. Gomez-Bravo believes that stock valuations “don’t leave much to compensate for the ongoing risks” in geopolitics, de-globalization, or debt loads. The quality of U.S. corporate debt is deteriorating rapidly, with downgrades being issued at the fastest pace since 2015, Bloomberg reports. Roelof Salomons, a professor of investment theory and asset management at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands, told the FT that there is “lots of optimism out there.” He sees “signs of classic late cycle market behavior” from M&A activity in “overdrive” and IPOs of unprofitable companies. Loss-making companies are raising more capital in 2019 from IPOs than in any prior year since 2000, during the dotcom bubble , per another Bloomberg report. Looking Ahead In 1996, Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve Chairman at the time, warned in a speech about "" irrational exuberance "" among investors that ""unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions."" The FT observes: ""Investor exuberance does not always mean a crash is coming, but it should make investors check their exposures."""
Markets Rise as Utility Stocks Drop,"Market Moves While the S&P 500 index ( SPX ), the benchmark for stock investors, paused on its way to new highs, one sector of stocks within that grouping is heading noticeably lower, namely utility stocks . This is usually a bullish indicator for the market at large, but the current circumstances may add a bit more complexity to the picture. The utility sector, as tracked by State Street's SPDR Utility Sector Index ETF ( XLU ) began to outpace the markets over the summer when headlines fueled investor nervousness about U.S.-China trade talks. Since the fourth quarter of the year began, however, stocks became resurgent, and investors began to rotate out of the utility sector and back into growth sectors. Shown below the price chart is a study that tracks the average true range of the S&P 500. When the benchmark index begins to outperform utility stocks and its volatility simultaneously decreases, then historically speaking, stocks have a 90% occurrence of increasing over the next quarter. But the factors adding to the decline of the utility sector include fires in California and the potential for rising interest rates. These two items could be clouding the forecast. The Financial Sector's Ball-and-Chain Rising interest rates may be a boon to the financial sector, and this is likely one of the reasons the sector has begun to surge higher recently. Interestingly enough, one industry luminary, Warren Buffett, has lagged behind the market, and even the financial sector itself. This is a particularly important fact considering how much his firm actually influences the financial sector index performance. The chart below shows how highly correlated shares for Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRK.B ), are to the financial sector as tracked by State Street's SPDR Financial Sector Index ETF ( XLF ). This is largely due to the fact that Berkshire is often among the largest holdings in the fund, but it is also related to the way so many within the industry attempt to emulate the ideas and workings of Buffett himself. Since the fund has lagged behind the sector, however, it is literally holding the sector down from performing better.

( WMT ) reports earnings later this week. It will be interesting to see whether the fortunes that have found their way to other retailers such as Target Corporation ( TGT ) and eluded other companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), will favor the Arkansas-based company or not. In general, it has been an upbeat quarter for retailers, but not all have fared equally. Walmart's recent strategy of keeping increased inventory in its stores coupled with more aggressive pricing is on review here. The quarterly results should help discover whether customers prefer it over the shiny remodeling accomplished in so many Target stores. The Bottom Line Stocks began the week with only a mild pull back from their highs. The low-volatility trading ranges continue even as utility stocks significantly decline. This could be bullish signal for the quarter ahead. The financial sector showed a bullish breakout last week, but Berkshire Hathaway seemed to hold it back a bit. Walmart reports earnings this week, and it may give insight into whether there is more than one way to beat online retailers.

Markets Wound Tight,"Market Moves In the current, low-impact news environment, the major market indexes have held in tight trading ranges each day for the past 12 trading sessions. Later this week or next, that dynamic may change as investors decide to make changes in their portfolio. While the S&P 500 ( SPX ) an Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) rose slightly on the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) remained essentially unchanged. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Joint Economic Committee members in Washington D.C. on Wednesday and on Thursday. In the absence of other news, this could change investors perceptions about the importance of what is happening in the U.S. economy. Their subsequent reaction might move market prices to a greater extent than they have moved in recent days. It wouldn't be the first time that traders and investors have overreacted to the Fed Chair's statements. If the news is positive, then market watchers might notice the impact on semiconductor manufacturers, which began a new upward trend this quarter. Among stocks in that industry, two stand out: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ( AMD ) and NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ), both of which may be benefiting from a renewed popular interest in bitcoin (see chart below). Interest Rates Could Rise, and Certain Stocks Would Benefit For the third time this year, the Federal Reserve cut its target lending rate. However, that hasn't stopped the 10-year Treasury Note index ( TNX ) from rising significantly since Oct. 1. It may be that markets eager to attract investors need to lift rates in order to entice more bond buyers to the table, but whatever the reason for increasing rates, it is usually a drag on the stock market and a mathematical negative to the bond market . But not all investments will find this condition to be a headwind. Consider that shares of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ( AMTD ) typically rise with the anticipation of higher interest rates. That's because the analysts know that the company's business model relies heavily on gains it makes from its holdings as interest rates rise. Stocks in the financial sector, as tracked by State Street's SPDR Financial Sector Index ETF ( XLF ), also tend to trend with rising interest rates (see chart below). Lastly, Barclays UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury fund ( TBT ), which trades as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with an inverse relationship to bond prices, is also tracking the rise of interest rates. Read more: AMD vs. NVIDIA: Which Stock Is a Better Buy? Why Corporate America Is Bullish on the Economy Why Investors Are Buying Beaten Up Assets Investors May be Finding Their Way Back to GE Shares of General Electric Company ( GE ) have made the best eight-day run in the stock's storied history. Prices have jumped based on the reports from GE's most recent quarterly earnings call, which were optimistic about the company's future prospects. The Bottom Line The trading range stocks have been constrained to over the past 12 trading sessions has occurred as the earnings season has begun to wind down and news headlines have driven less and less fear among investors. Interest rates may begin to rise if the 10-year Treasury note index is any indicator, and this will lead certain stocks higher. Investors looking for stronger returns may be tempted to consider low-priced shares of a formerly strong company such as General Electric.

Danger Ahead?,"Market Moves The S&P 500 index ( SPX ) closed on a dramatic new high as it gapped above all previous prices for the week. It has also completed five consecutive weeks full of smaller-than-average daily trading ranges. Both of these conditions are bullish indications. The volatility index ( VIX ) shows that reduced volatility isnt limited to trading ranges, but it is also evident in the reduced premiums paid for options . Since options primarily act as a hedge against unexpected large price moves, a decrease in the amount charged for options implies a decreased expectation of risk. The chart below shows that the VIX has been on the decline for the past month or more and is approaching a level that marks a new multi-month low. Some analysts have sounded warning signals about possible risks in the market ahead, but such indications are not evident in this chart. Comparing the two highlighted time frames, it becomes apparent that the former period near year end in 2017 featured both rising VIX levels and increases in the SPX. Since this is not the case today, chart readers can infer that investors and option sellers are not in fear of price drops at this time. A Bearish Warning Signal Hangs Over the Nasdaq 100 Recent reports that the Hindenburg Omen warning signal appeared specifically for the Nasdaq 100 index ( NDX ) may seem overplayed considering the relatively calm state of the markets as of the close today. But that is the nature of this particular indicator – it measures a condition that often appears in what may be overly bullish markets. This indicator is rather complicated, and you rarely see it laid out on a chart because it has a couple of components that make it hard to spot in a single data point. The chart below tries to provide a better look an how this indicator touched off this week. The price action of Invesco's Nasdaq 100-tracking ETF ( QQQ ) shows how this index has plodded steadily higher over the past three weeks. The next indicator under the price action details the number of stocks making new 52-week highs (green portion of the bars) and those making 52-week lows (red portion of the bars) within the index. About two weeks ago, enough of the stocks in the index made new extremes, but the proportion of highs to lows was more than double (this is a disqualifying characteristic). Then earlier this week, a condition appeared that met the criteria for a valid signal as well as a confirmation from the McClellan Oscillator . This indicator has a reasonable track record. So perhaps it is time to move all investments to cash? Not so fast. Read more: Almost Time to Sell Tesla Stock 5 Warning Signs of Market 'Euphoria' Cisco Systems Stock Could Enter Long-Term Downtrend Price Behavior Uncharacteristic of Investor Nervousness Inexperienced technical analysis or chart enthusiasts may get the impression that an indicator like the Hindenburg Omen requires that investors act immediately to diffuse a ticking time bomb in their portfolio. But the reality is that, while price action can give worthwhile indications, investor behavior is what drives prices higher or lower in rapid order. If investors show no corroborating behavior, it is highly likely that the doom forecast is yet distant at best. Consider the following two charts. The first shows that neither the relative strength index nor the stochastic oscillator detail a bearish divergence in the price action. Similarly, a comparison of a hedger's portfolio (made up of equal parts gold, bonds, and cash) shows no signs of increased demand as it did right before a brief market sell-off in August. The price action seems to indicate that investors, so far, simply aren't panicking. S&P 500 vs. gold, Treasury bonds, and cash The Bottom Line While S&P 500 traded to another record-high close, the volatility index brushed against multi-month lows, demonstrating investor complacency. Under such circumstances, it isn't surprising to see the Hindenburg Omen flash a signal. But unlike times past where the market responded dreadfully after such an indication, neither price action nor investor behavior are corroborating the signal this time around.

Small Is Beautiful,"Market Moves While the major market indexes continue to make new highs, the Russell 2000 index ( RUT ) shows signs that investors are once again taking an interest in small companies with growth potential. This is a typical reaction when investors perceive that larger companies are growing too slowly for their tastes. The chart below details how small-cap stocks have broken above the nearly year-long channel they have maintained until the past week. The significance of this activity cannot be understated, since it implies that markets could well be on track to rise through the end of 2019 and beyond. This behavior shows that investors are actively seeking opportunities for investment growth. Under such circumstances, more investors tend to hold on to their investments, thus reducing volatility in the markets. Reduced volatility attracts more investors, creating a virtuous cycle. U.S. Dollar Holds Top Position Among Major Currencies While U.S. stock market indexes experienced an increase of volatility in their price action for 2018 and so far in 2019, at least some U.S. investors may have been scared out of the markets altogether and favored keeping their money in cash. Perhaps that is one explanation for why the U.S. dollar has maintained a largely dominant growth trajectory among major currencies over the past two years. When investors move out of stocks, it creates more demand for cash, in this case specifically U.S. dollars. The chart below compares the U.S. dollar's relative value against several of Invesco's CurrencyShares ETFs that track various currencies. The Japanese yen is tracked by FXY , The Canadian Dollar is tracked by FXC , the British pound is tracked by FXB , the euro is tracked by FXE , the Australian dollar is tracked by FXA , and the Chinese yuan is tracked by Wisdom Tree's ETF with ticker symbol CYB .

Arrowhead Shares Are Still Alerting Big Buy Signals 3 Europe ETFs Breaking Out Ahead of Brexit Deadline Brexit Headlines Driving British Pound Higher Although most of the major currencies have lagged behind the U.S. dollar in a longer time frame, in a shorter-term look, one currency, the British pound (GBP), has gained significant traction and has risen in relative value to the U.S. dollar. Ever since news of Boris Johnson's determined push towards Brexit took the forefront, the currency has trended higher. This makes it worthwhile for investors to consider whether the market, collectively speaking, actually prefers the Brexit outcome. If so, it would seem to imply that Britain's economic fate may be improved by the move. The Bottom Line While S&P 500 traded to another record-high close, the Russell 2000 held unchanged in a position that shows the index broke out of its lengthy price channel. This may portend a rise higher in the months ahead. The U.S. stock market's increased volatility may have driven some investors to cash over the past two years, helping fuel the rise of relative value in the greenback compared to other currencies. In recent months, however, Brexit headlines have helped the British pound surge higher. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Why Rich Investors Are Bracing for a Steep Sell-Off as Turmoil Looms,"Bullish buyers have sent the S&P 500 Index soaring to a series of record highs this month, but wealthy investors are bracing for a significant market decline by the end of 2020, and now hold, on average, 25% of their assets in cash, according to a worldwide survey by UBS Global Wealth Management that drew more than 3,400 responses. Moreover, 60% of respondents plan to increase their cash allocations yet more, according to a detailed report in Bloomberg summarized below. “The rapidly changing geopolitical environment is the biggest concern for investors around the world,” as Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS GWM, observed in a statement. “They see global interconnectivity and reverberations of change impacting their portfolios more than traditional business fundamentals, a marked change from the past."" Key Takeaways Wealthy clients surveyed by UBS expect a big stock market selloff. They are building high cash balances as a defensive measure. They also seek more diversification and higher-quality stocks. However, they are optimistic about future investment returns. Significance for Investors UBS polled investors with $1 million or more in investable assets, which include cash and marketable securities, but exclude residences and personal property. The survey was conducted between August and October 2019. Other key findings of the survey were: nearly 80% expect volatility to increase, 55% anticipate a significant stock market selloff before the end of 2020, and 62% look to increase their diversification across asset classes. While the average allocation to cash among respondents was 25%, this was down from 32% in an earlier iteration of the survey in May. Also, per a report in Barron's about the survey, 52% are uncertain whether it is a good time to invest now, but 64% are thinking about increasing their holdings of high quality stocks. Another interesting point is that the bearish sentiment among these wealthy investors relates only to the short term, since 70% are optimistic about investment returns across the next 10 years. This stands in sharp contrast to the long term pessimism of various market pundits, who have been predicting dismal investment returns across the next decade, or even longer, per previous reports . These investors are responding to short term uncertainty “by really shortening their time horizons and shifting to assets like cash that are safe,” observes Michael Crook, a managing director with the UBS investment strategy team. Meanwhile, Tim Courtney, chief investment officer (CIO) of Exencial Wealth Advisors, indicates that some ultra-cautious wealthy clients have put up to half their portfolios in cash, per another Barron's report. Looking Ahead Money fund balances have surpassed $3.4 trillion, a 10-year high, and are still rising. While many observers take this as a bearish sign, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS, including Paula Polito, have a bullish interpretation. For example, BofAML's proprietary Cash Rule Indicator gives a contrarian buy signal for stocks when cash balances are above their long term averages, as they have been for nearly two years, per The Wall Street Journal ."
Big Buying in Software and Biotech Stocks Is Bullish,"It's not fair. Reality is not perception, but perception is reality. Suppose I said that cows are 20 times more deadly than sharks. You'd spit out your burger laughing at me. But it's true; those docile cows kill more Americans each year than sharks, bears, alligators, snakes, and spiders – combined! Humans, though, are the biggest killers on earth. But we live thinking sharks are all Jaws, and poisonous spiders and snakes are out to get us. Bears lurk in the shed when we take out the trash, ready to maul us. Truth is, they're all doing their thing, and so are we. Usually, nothing happens. But fear rules because it sells. A friendly shark movie wouldn't make it past studio execs. They know the ""Jaws"" franchise did the equivalent of $2 billion in today's dollars globally. Similarly, the market might conjure images of big bad bear claws more than charging bull horns. But reality says that bulls are large and in charge. The Mapsignals Big Money Index measures unusual buying against selling. It surged to 71.2%. A month ago, it was 51.9%. Buying like that coming from nowhere can be spooky. When professional money managers suddenly all go hard into stocks, it creates FOMO. But how long can buying like that last? We're not likely getting overbought this week (80%-plus is overbought). We could stay this way for a while. We'd need several huge-buying days in a row to get overbought. A few more days like Friday, a 92% buying day. Eventually, the market will need to vent and pull back. But today, buyers are in control. Let's focus on what they’re buying. Friday gave us a good idea. It was the biggest day of health care buying since June 15, 2018. Nearly 20% of the universe logged a buy – in one day! www.mapsignals.com The next set of charts shows a little context for the type of buying we are seeing in health care. The first chart shows net buys/sells for the health care sector. When there's more buying than selling, there's a green bar. More selling means a red bar. The second chart shows a stretch of huge buying in the biotech industry (most of last week's buying was in biotech). The green sticks appear when there is more than 150% buying on a 30-day moving average. How do we use these charts to help us decide when to get in? Health care www.mapsignals.com Biotech www.mapsignals.com On the chart of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLV ), those looking for a safer trend development will notice that, when there's big buying (ramping green spikes), the longer term shows appreciation. Those looking for bargains will notice that, when there's a sea of red, it's a good time to grab a deal – but scarier. Those looking for optimal timing and safety will notice that the best time to pay attention is when we get green buying right after heavy selling. This is the setup in the past week or so, with good-sized selling followed by a rush in, like air rushing into a vacuum. As I said above, the buying in health care was heavily tilted toward biotech. Of the 82 buy signals last week, 50 were biotech. Looking at the chart of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF ( XBI ), just isolating biotech, you'll notice that patches of heavy buying are often followed by higher prices. In fact, when buying ramped up in early 2017, it preceded a six-month 60% rally in XBI. Another place to pay attention is tech. We see the same type of charts below. Net buying (green) has picked up in tech after a nasty patch of selling. This bodes well for future prices in the info tech sector. Here we use the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK ) as a gauge. Again: what exactly is getting bought in tech? Tech showed 68 buys for the week, and 21 of those were semiconductors. That's not surprising, as we have been harping on it for a while. What is a surprise is that software showed 36 of those 68 buys. This is the industry that got torched late September into October. It was toxic, but again, not because the sector was fundamentally weak. We believe portfolio managers got the tap on the shoulder to sell winners to pay for losers after a rough summer. Software was the biggest winner for a while. You can see this clearly in the chart of the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ) on the right. It basically serves as an index to track the software industry stocks. What's interesting is when we see that big buying. Those green bars are 150% the 30-day moving average of software buying. When it perks up, it means big gains. If you look closely at the bottom right of the chart, you'll see that it just started again. After nasty selling last month, the buyers are stepping back in. Gun to my head: software stocks are in for a rise. www.mapsignals.com Bulls and bears can duke it out on CNBC. What really matters is the data: what’s actually happening? The same goes for human-killers. Jaws gets the bad rap, but statistically, it's those evil cows you gotta watch out for. Ultimately, it's you who must trust where your information comes from. Most of the time, those who feed it to you want you to perceive things the way they sell them: so you buy what they sell. Arm yourself with data. Stephen King said it sweetly: ""The trust of the innocent is the liar's most useful tool."" The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
Heavy Hitters Drive Nasdaq 100 Performance,"Market Moves The Nasdaq 100 index ( NDX ) closed slightly higher and traded within a tighter-than-average trading range . This price action has been repeated many days in the past several weeks, so much so that investors may be tempted to think that stocks will keep going higher like this for a long time to come. The reality is that this outcome is highly unlikely if for no other reason than that stocks have not behaved that way in the past. The chart below shows that the Nasdaq 100, as tracked by Invesco's index-tracking ETF ( QQQ ), has traded with a smaller-than-average trading range for 27 consecutive days now. With the exception of the extreme run-up at the beginning of 2019, a string of days that have traded with decreasing volatility for 32 consecutive trading sessions has not happened in over a decade. The current action is only five sessions away from that. This level of low volatility is so unusual that it may create a sharp pullback as investors inadvertently decide to take profits on the same day at some point in the future. The Nasdaq 100 Is Driven by Five Companies The Nasdaq 100 Index is calculated by a modified capitalization methodology that includes the top 100 stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. You might be tempted to think that this index is made up of an equal influence of 100 different companies, but that would be incorrect. The weightings differ based on price of the stock and the number of outstanding shares – in short the market capitalization . This becomes especially true as index components begin to shift upward in price relative to their peers. Under such circumstances, the influence on the index by a single stock tends to outpace its peers, sometimes in dramatic ways. Consider the pie chart below, which details the weightings of the five largest stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index: Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), Alphabet Inc. Class C ( GOOG ) and Alphabet Inc. Class A ( GOOGL ), and Facebook, Inc. ( FB ). (Note that GOOG and GOOGL are actually the same company.) The combined weighting of these five companies is 46% of the calculation that goes into determining the price of the Nasdaq 100 Index – almost as much as the remaining 95 companies combined. Read more: How Stocks Defying Bulls Could Plunge Into a Bear Market Territory Qualcomm Stock Sets Multi-Year High on Earnings Why Rich Investors Are Bracing for a Steep Sell-Off as Turmoil Looms Can the Nasdaq 100 Move Higher Without Those Five? If you consider the heavy tilt of the Nasdaq 100 index toward its five most influential companies, then an interesting question comes into focus. Investors might want to know where those five companies are headed relative to the index itself. The chart below provides a quick view. This chart compares the Nasdaq 100 (green line) with an equal-weighted portfolio of those top five companies (blue line). The portfolio of these companies seems to be noticeably diverging away from the index itself. This divergence would be even more dramatic if the influence of the top stocks were taken out (for this illustration they are not). It begs the question: can the index keep going up if its heavyweights are not doing so? The Bottom Line Despite closing lower than its open, the Nasdaq 100 closed higher on low-range trading. This marks the 27th consecutive session in which it has done so. A pullback might come soon because this length of a streak is rare. In fact, a quick comparison view of the Nasdaq 100 index and its top components shows that those components are diverging significantly and may drag the index lower if that is the direction they end up moving.

At Your Discretion,"Market Moves The S&P 500 index ( SPX ) continued its plodding, deliberate move higher, closing a scant 0.05% above unchanged. The Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) did slightly better. Traders and investors looking for quick gains are having difficulty knowing where to look. Under such circumstances, a quick look at the market sector can prove instructive, since investors are likely turning toward sector-rotation strategies when the market starts to move more slowly. The chart below shows the lead amassed by the technology sector, as tracked by iShares' sector-tracking SPDR ETFs for basic materials ( XLB ), energy ( XLE ), financials ( XLF ), industrials ( XLI ), technology ( XLK ), consumer staples ( XLP ), utilities ( XLU ), health care ( XLV ), and consumer discretionary ( XLY ). Some studies suggest that the best gains are to be had in the second place and second-to-last place sectors. The studies suggest that stocks in these sectors are more likely than others to be in a fast-growing sector 90-days from now. With this in mind, taking a closer look at the financial sector and the consumer discretionary sector might be worthwhile. The Discretionary Sector Could Break Out When a particular sector is relatively undervalued compared to its peers, it is also interesting to find a particular price pattern apparent on its chart. Price patterns may not have much in the way of predictive value, but they do indicate a price dynamic that can become a contributing factor should institutional investors take action on the sector. The chart below shows a pennant pattern that has formed on XLY. This pattern sets up the possibility that a small change in price (higher) will grab attention from technical traders and institutional investors alike. This added attention could contribute to an unusual pace of appreciation should the market continue higher. Read more: 8 Blue Chips Crushing S&P 500 as Global Profits Surge 10 Bargain Cyclical Stocks That Will Lead as Economy Rebounds Strong Holiday Sales Could Underpin Major Retailers A Change in the Stream The battle for dominance in streaming entertainment may take an interesting turn. The Walt Disney Company's ( DIS ) new Disney Plus service was apparently underwhelming to many early adopters, but this only served to generate headlines to many who were unaware that it had launched (or that it existed). Meanwhile, the added attention has led some analysts to increase their estimates for Disney, and by extension, Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ) as well. An interesting comparison shapes up if you overlay a chart of one portfolio composed of half Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) and half Comcast Corporation ( CMCSA ) with another portfolio of 50% Disney and 50% Netflix. Just this past week, the Disney-Netflix duo has overtaken the other portfolio for the year's performance. A continued rise by these stocks would go a long way to accelerate the discretionary sector. The Bottom Line While major market indexes traded to another record-high close, they did so very quietly. Under such circumstances, it isn't surprising to find opportunities in a sector comparison chart. As it happens, the consumer discretionary sector may be setting up to break out of its consolidating price pattern and make a significant acceleration. Disney and Netflix may contribute to such a move, as both have risen rapidly in the past week. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Tech Stocks Racing Toward Best Gains in Decade Despite Red Flags,"Information technology stocks were widely seen as dangerously overvalued a year ago, yet they are having their best year since 2009, rising 40% year-to-date as of the close on Nov. 20, 2019, versus 24% for the S&P 500. “This is where the growth is over the long term, so you’re always going to get a pretty good bid” for tech stocks, as Katie Nixon, chief investment officer (CIO) for Northern Trust Wealth Management, told The Wall Street Journal in a detailed report summarized below. Tech stocks have outperformed recently even as value stocks have started to rebound. Moreover, the tech stocks that have posted especially big gains are a diverse group. Some examples, with their YTD gains are: FAAMG members Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), +67%, and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ), +47%, credit card giants Visa Inc. ( V ), +38%, and Mastercard Inc. ( MA ), +51%, as well as Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT ), +82%, ASML Holding NV ( ASML ), +73%, and Lam Research Corp. ( LRCX ), +101%, all three of which manufacture the capital equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers. Key Takeaways Tech stocks are leading the market by a wide margin in 2019. However, tech is among the worst sectors for Q3 2019 earnings. Valuations remain high, adding to the risks. Significance for Investors ""This is an environment where we’re finding opportunities,” says Eric Wiegand, a portfolio manager in the private wealth division of U.S. Bank. His firm has focused on software and service companies among its tech holdings. Among the FAANG stocks, note that Facebook Inc. ( FB ), Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ), and Google parent Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) were shifted in 2018 from the information technology sector to the new communication services sector, which is up 27% YTD. Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) is in the consumer discretionary sector, given that retailing is its core business. Tech stocks are soaring despite major warning signs. Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, information technology had weaker Q3 2019 year-over-year (YOY) earnings growth than 8 other sectors, with a 5.4% decline per FactSet Research Systems. However, this represented an improvement from the even lower expectations voiced by analysts as of June 30, when the consensus called for a 9.4% drop. Communication services is on track to report Q3 earnings that are roughly flat YOY, while earnings for consumer discretionary are down by about 2%. For the S&P 500 as a whole, the Q3 earnings decline is trending towards 2.3%. Another problem is that some of the biggest names in technology, broadly defined, are showing reduced momentum. Amazon.com announced its first quarterly earnings decline in more than two years, while Netflix failed for a second straight quarter to meet its goals for subscriber growth. Among the FAANG stocks, only Apple and Alphabet, +25% YTD, have hit new highs in recent months. Amazon is a market laggard, with a 14% YTD gain, as is Netflix, +13%. Facebook, meanwhile, is up 51% despite being the focus of intense scrutiny in Washington. Looking Ahead Tech stocks remain pricey. The forward P/E ratio for the information technology sector is about 21 times projected earnings over the 12 months, versus a ratio of 18 times for the S&P 500 as a whole, per FactSet. Communication services is also valued at roughly at 18 times projected next 12 month earnings. Such a valuation premium for information technology implies expectations that profit growth will resume. If that does not happen in the near future, the sector may be riding for a fall."
Why Contrarian Goldman Sees an Economic Rebound,"Despite widespread worries that the U.S. will experience declining economic growth in 2020, and perhaps slip into a recession , Goldman Sachs predicts a rebound. ""Our economists forecast U.S. real GDP growth will accelerate beyond 2%, reaching a pace of 2.3% in early 2020. Their estimate for full-year average annual GDP growth is 2.1%, above the consensus growth rate of 1.8%,"" according to Goldman's current U.S. Weekly Kickstart report. Other informed observers offer a contrasting view. For example, U.S. corporate CEOs are less confident than at any prior time since the global financial crisis of 2008, while 67% of CFOs at large U.S. companies expect a recession by the end of 2020, per previous reports . Key Takeaways Goldman Sachs expects U.S. economic growth to rebound in 2020. Their forecast is more optimistic than the consensus. Morgan Stanley sees a global rebound in 2020, but an uneven one. They find stock valuations to be high versus economic fundamentals. Significance for Investors Among the components of GDP, Goldman forecasts that residential and business fixed Investment will see the biggest growth. Additionally, they predict that 4 key forces will drive an uptick in U.S. economic growth: (1) The stimulative impact of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will continue to flow through the economy in the next few quarters. In particular, their economists find that easing financial conditions historically take about 3 full quarters to reach their peak effect on GDP. (2) Tariffs, and their negative economic impacts, appear to have peaked. Their base case is that U.S. tariffs on imports from China will be unchanged in 2020. (3) Inventory-to-sales ratios have been declining, suggesting a manufacturing rebound ahead, as companies increase production to meet demand and rebuild inventories. In particular, the proportion of small businesses planning to increase inventories reached its highest level of the year in October. (4) Negative impacts of ""Idiosyncratic events"" such as the General Motors strike and falling oil prices should subside in 2020. Goldman expects that resolution of the strike will spark a rebound in automobile production, and in payroll growth. Meanwhile, the negative impact of lower oil prices on the energy industry should be more than offset by the positive impact of lower costs on other industries and consumers, especially as prices stabilize. Right now, Goldman cites several positive indicators for the U.S. economy. Non-farm payrolls increased by 128,000 in October, sending the recent trend up to 175,000. Home sales were up by 5% year-over-year in September and October. After dropping for 6 straight months, the ISM Manufacturing Index rose moderately in October, while the ISM Non-Manufacturing index also increased. On Friday, the core retail sales also showed an increase. Looking Ahead Morgan Stanley is a leading Wall Street firm with a more pessimistic view. They expect earnings estimates for the S&P 500 during the next 12 months to be revised downward, per a recent issue of the Weekly Warm-Up report from their U.S. equity strategy team headed by Mike Wilson. ""We expect to see weak [economic] growth in 2020,"" they write. In another report, the 2020 Global Strategy Outlook, Morgan Stanley's economists expect global economic growth to improve starting in Q1 2020, but that it will be ""uneven."" Moreover, they find that stock market valuations are still high versus previous points in history when the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) began to emerge from a trough. They also write that ""US risk assets are too expensive for the modest [economic] pick-up we forecast."""
Markets See First Significant Selling in Over a Month,"Market Moves The S&P 500 ( SPX ) and the Nasdaq 100 index ( NDX ) fell today during the most significant degree of selling activity in over a month. Despite these moves, the indexes showed enough buying to bring their close into the upper half of today's trading range . This is more likely to be a bullish signal, as it shows investors are willing to step in and buy up any kind of dip right now. However, a subtle undercurrent of concern is building in the options markets , where the CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX ) has begun to show a break in its normal pattern of inverse correlation. The chart below shows that the VIX usually maintains a strict inverse correlation with the SPX, but on rare occasions when the correlation seems to diminish or completely reverse, the event becomes a significant marker in time, from which the market may reverse its course over the short term. The current reading of this correlation is actually much higher than normal. (Click on the chart to see an enlarged version of the graphic.) This could portend an extended sell off in the not-too-distant future. Bond Markets Not Worried About Stock Market Instability If the market were to have an extended period where prices fell and investors did more selling than buying, it would be useful to have some indication of whether it could turn into a full-blown bear market or not. The 20% decline that the major indexes showed at the end of last year could just have easily led to a major market decline – instead, it produced one of the best buying opportunities of the decade. While no indicator calls every market turn perfectly, professional analysts agree that intermarket indications tend to precede such turns more often than not. Under such circumstances as we observe in the stock market, it becomes useful to review what alternatives investors have and where they might take their money if stocks became a disappointment. This includes bond markets and precious metals. An interesting analysis of the bond markets can be found by observing the degree of correlation between bond prices as tracked by iShares' 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( TLT ) and interest rates as tracked by CBOE's 10 Year Treasury Note Yield Index ( TNX ). These two instruments are expected to be inversely correlated. When they diverge from that inverse correlation, it becomes a potential indicator of change (see the areas marked on the chart). The current level represents an extremely tight inverse correlation, so the bond markets are not poised to change from a downward trend to an upward trend any time soon. Read more: Why Investors Should Brace for a 50% Volatility Spike and Steep Losses Why Contrarian Goldman Sees an Economic Rebound Caterpillar Stock Could Offer Low-Risk Buying Opportunity Gold and Silver Markets Remain Steady If investors didn't want to buy bonds or simply move their money to cash, they might consider buying precious metals. If so, we would expect to see a jump in demand for gold or silver during a period of time when stock prices were falling. During such conditions, the price of gold and silver may not rise in carefully coordinated ways. Therefore, observing the correlation between gold and silver prices can be useful in determining major market turning points. The chart below compares the price of gold as tracked by State Street's gold-tracking ETF ( GLD ) with the price of silver as tracked by iShares' silver-tracking ETF ( SLV ). You can see that these price patterns do exhibit important disruption at major turning points, just as they did last year (see marking on chart). But these two instruments do not show any degree of similar indication right now. The conclusion would be that investors are not showing any increase of interest in alternatives to stocks, and for the moment, they stand ready to buy the dips in any upward trend. The Bottom Line Despite closing lower today, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 closed in the upper half of their trading ranges, signifying that some investors still want to be buyers. Neither bond price action nor the prices of precious metals show any indication that investors are ready to move money away from stocks and into these markets. This implies that a bear market is unlikely to begin right now. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Investors Show No Panic During Second Day of Selling,"Market Moves The major stock market indexes fell only slightly as investors continued their second day of significant selling. The tepid attempt at profit taking may imply that investors will soon be eager to resume their bullish strategies. For further evidence of this, we need only compare a collection of stock index ETFs with bond index ETFs. The chart below shows a stock portfolio made up of equal parts from each of the three large-cap indexes: S&P 500 ( SPX ), Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ); compared with a portfolio of four popular bond ETFs from iShares, including the 20-year Bond fund ( TLT ), the 7-10 year Treasury Bond fund ( IEF ), the High Yield Corporate Bond fund ( HYG ), and the Municipal Bond fund ( MUB ). This important comparison shows a deep undercurrent in this simple price movement. The price change implies that billions of dollars have moved from bonds to stocks in just the past two months and more will continue to do so. This is good news for stock investors, because bond market investors are usually oriented around longer investing time frames. This movement from one asset class to another suggests that the many investors making this move right now are interested in a long-term investing time frame. Consequently, it portends a bullish forecast for stocks in the next several months. Consumers Balancing Needs and Wants With Black Friday approaching, analysts are turning an eye to the retail sector to try to gauge where opportunity may best be found ahead of the holiday shopping season. The effort necessary to determine where such investing opportunity can be uncovered may be as simple as comparing the two major segments of the retail market: those that cater to consumers needs versus their wants. Something that any shrewd chart watcher can do is to compare these two segments in a unique way by looking at just six stocks: Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) and The Home Depot Company ( HD ) for the wants, and The Coca-Cola Company ( KO ), PepsiCo, Inc. ( PEP ), Walmart Inc. ( WMT ), and Procter & Gamble ( PG ) for the needs. These six stocks represent the most heavily held components in the sector ETFs that track consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors respectively. The chart below demonstrates this comparison for 2019. Amazon and Home Depot have pulled back, and all six stocks have flattened their trend. Unless this is the beginning of a longer-term bearish sentiment in the market, then a pattern like this is usually a good indication that the discretionary stocks, the wants, are becoming undervalued and may soon rise higher as better news unfolds. Historically, the wants tend to lead the needs, but since the markets are rather complacent right now, a bearish break lower is unlikely. Read more: Who Is Winning the First Round of Commission-Free Trading? Bullish Traders Are Shifting Their Focus to Retail Schwab Rumored to Buy Rival TDA in $26 Billion Deal Broker Merger Might be Good for Consumers If retail trading customers might like the idea of two popular brokerages merging platforms and services, investors appear to be in love with the idea. The chart below provides the proof. As news broke that The Charles Schwab Corporation ( SCHW ) was rumored to have made a bid to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ( AMTD ), shares of the former closed over 7% higher, while shares of the latter closed nearly 17% percent higher. Investors and analysts alike might be tempted to dismiss this outcome as the result of merely plugging the buyout bid into a valuation model for the two companies, but there is likely more to it than that. Consider the hurdles for Schwab, such as the overall cost of the transaction and the challenges to merge the companies without reducing the value of customers' experiences. Furthermore, the company would need to do this in an environment without the revenue from trading commissions (a $100 million dollar annual loss just for Schwab by its own admission). The fact that the price of Schwab shares did not trade lower at the open is a big vote of confidence from investors. More importantly, this price action implies that analysts and investors alike consider a positive outcome for the endeavor to be more likely than otherwise. If you think about this response in that light, then by itself, the price jump is a bullish forecast of the stock market and the overall U.S. economy. The Bottom Line Despite closing lower yesterday, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 maintained tight trading ranges, indicating that sellers are not feeling a sense of panic. Retail consumers may soon drive sales revenues higher, potentially benefiting investors in discretionary stocks more than those holding consumer staples stocks. The market's reaction to the rumored merger between Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade may actually imply a bullish expectation for the stock market.

Big Cap Stock Pickers Lose Big Amid $250 Billion in Outflows,"Amid the raging bull market, a big source of disappointment for investors has been persistent underperformance by actively-managed large cap equity mutual funds. Despite a modest rebound from their 2019 low point in terms of performance versus benchmarks, only 28% of these funds are beating their benchmarks this year, down from an average of 34% since 2009, Goldman Sachs reports. As a result, actively-managed large cap mutual funds are beset by large net withdrawals of funds by investors. The aggregate year-to-date outflow through Oct. 31, 2019 was $229 billion, roughly in line with the average of $234 billion during the same period in the past four years, per Goldman's Mutual Fundamentals report released on Nov. 20. At the pace recorded through October, full year 2019 is on track to see net withdrawals of $275 billion, which would be the largest annual figure since 2016. Key Takeaways Large cap actively-managed mutual funds are seeing large withdrawals. Most of these funds are lagging the market, more than in recent years. On average, they have been underweight in the best performing stocks. Lower outflows are likely in 2020, as policy uncertainty rises. Significance for Investors Goldman studied the portfolios of 617 funds with an aggregate $2.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM) . Part of the performance problem is that the most overweight fund positions have lagged the most underweight positions by 125 basis points (bp) , and the full S&P 500 Index by 150 bp, through October. Among the top 10 overweights are Google parent Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ), Visa Inc. ( V ), Adobe Inc. ( ADBE ), and MasterCard Inc. ( MA ). The 10 most underweight stocks include Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ), Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B ( BRK.B ). Looking at sectors rather than stocks, the average large cap mutual fund is underweight in information technology, the best performing sector in 2019 . However, these funds also are overweight in the laggards, including health care and consumer discretionary . ""Funds raised their overweight exposure to cyclicals to the highest level since 2Q 2017,"" Goldman writes. They add: ""Funds increased their relative allocation to Industrials (primarily Capital Goods) and Semiconductors. However, the current overweight to cyclicals still remains below [their 7-year] average."" Nonetheless, ""the cyclical bias of mutual fund sector exposures has supported fund outperformance in recent weeks."" Goldman also found that the funds most likely outperform were those with the most concentrated portfolios and the largest exposures to non-U.S. stocks. Regarding concentration, the report finds that funds holding fewer than 100 stocks are performing significantly better than those with more than 100. On international exposure, 33% of funds with at least 5% of their portfolios in non-U.S. stocks are beating the market in 2019, while only 28% of those with no overseas equities are doing so. Meanwhile, although the percentage of large cap actively-managed mutual funds that are beating their benchmarks has slipped to 28% in 2019 from a 10-year average of 34%, absolute returns are up sharply compared to the last 5 years. Through October, the median fund in this universe produced a YTD return of 25%, versus an average of only 7% from 2014 through 2018. Looking Ahead ""We expect lower outflows from active funds next year than each of the past four years because trade tensions and the 2020 US Presidential election will likely keep uncertainty elevated. History suggests that investor outflows from mutual funds are smallest following periods of high policy uncertainty,"" Goldman indicates."
Quiet Markets See Agricultural Commodities on the Rise,"Market Moves The markets for stocks, bonds, and currencies have been remarkably less volatile than usual. Even commodities have had mixed results, with gold and silver reducing volatility while oil has increased slightly. One of the markets easily overlooked is that of agricultural commodities. Although this segment of the market has not performed well in 2019, in recent months, prices have, for the most part, been on the rise. The chart below shows a comparison of Invesco's Deutche Bank-Index-based agriculture fund ( DBA ) with other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track agricultural commodities including cocoa ( NIB ), coffee ( JO ), wheat ( WEAT ), soybeans ( SOYB ), sugar ( SGG ), and corn ( CORN ). Since the end of summer, and likely in anticipation of a favorable harvest season and new crop year, these commodities have been on the rise. The one exception among these is CORN, which may be more sensitive to the rising value of the U.S. dollar and the U.S.-China trade negotiations. The most notable increase in these commodity prices has come in cocoa and coffee. The importance of looking through such charts is that it can help a trader or investor recognize where new opportunities might appear next. Stocks that might benefit from these trends might now be positioned to return well from current levels. Farm Equipment Manufacturers Remain in Uptrend Investopedia contributor Tim Smith wrote a worthwhile piece detailing the current positions of three farming stocks. Considering the current environment, this topic is rather timely. The chart below is a quick snapshot of these stocks and demonstrates how these have been trending higher through the summer. That their current status shows them slightly pulled back from their highs is consistent with the market at large. However, the important point is that all three stocks, Deere & Company ( DE ), Lindsay Corporation ( LNN ), and CNH Industrial N.V. ( CNHI ), have maintained the appearance of their upward trend despite the pullback. Read more: Big Cap Stock Pickers Lose Big Amid $250 Billion in Outflows Tech Stocks Racing Toward Best Gains in Decade Despite Red Flags Pullback in Farming Equipment Stocks Offers Trading Opportunity Chocolate Maker on Sale? If the commodity rising fastest is cocoa, it might make sense to go looking for which company might have its share prices influenced by an increased demand for cocoa. The biggest player in the industry is undoubtedly The Hershey Company ( HSY ). The chart below shows that the company had performed very well through the first half of the year but has had a significant pullback from its highs since then. Perhaps it is not surprising that the fall in Hershey share prices coincides with a rise in cocoa prices, but what is surprising is what an excellent trading setup this appears to be. While Hershey shares may drift lower in the near future, the breakout of this channel might portend a resumption of the trend higher. Shrewd chart watchers will want to keep an eye on the price of cocoa to see if its price corresponds with a change in Hershey share prices. Such a coordinated move could reveal a superb trading or investing opportunity before the end of the year. The Bottom Line Quiet trading in most markets today left the major indexes little changed from yesterday's close. Agricultural commodities appear to be on the rise, and farm equipment manufacturers appear to be rising coincidentally. Cocoa prices are moving up strongly, and this may have an effect on Hershey's shares. Despite this, the stock looks like it has an opportunistic setup.

"Stocks Are Getting Bought, but Not Overbought Yet","To teach a kid a lesson, keep it simple. Tell him in plain language what he did wrong, and give a simple punishment that fits the offense. Right? Throw the ball in the house and break something, you clean it up and work to replace it. Adults make it complicated. We have a convoluted legal system with infinite loopholes and even more shades of gray. So it's funny to hear about an adult getting a kid's punishment. In 2012, a Cleveland woman made the obvious bad choice to ""go around"" a stopped school bus. Instead of just giving her a ticket, the judge ordered her to stand at the scene of the crime with a self-made sign for two days. It read: ""Only an idiot would drive on the sidewalk to avoid a school bus."" Simple right? So, how many times have you had to say: ""let me break it down for you?"" Simple direct language does the trick. As a writer, I'm often guilty of ""too many words."" It makes the reader miss the message. All day, every day, the financial media debates bull or bear. They have people on who think the world is ending or just getting going. But no one just tells it like it is. But I will: Markets are going up because of big buying. This is happening in growth industries. It will continue to go up until the sellers show up. They aren't here yet, so the party will keep going. Here are the details. Starting at the top, the Mapsignals Big Money Index (BMI) measures huge trading in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It looks at 5,500 stocks each day for above-average buying and selling. Signals happen on about 100 stocks a day – less than 2%. But this 2% is extremely powerful and drives markets. It's like 2% of the population holds 90% of the wealth. Or 2% of pro athletes dominate all the stats. The truth is: this the juice is in the outliers. So, when I see big unusual stuff happening within the unusual stuff, I must pay attention. It's like when LeBron James is outplaying LeBron James! The BMI is at 72.5%. This means that 72.5% of all big trading signals are buys. It's measured on a 25-day moving average to keep it smooth. This is a lot of buying, and it makes sense that markets would push higher. When demand outstrips supply, we all know that prices go up. If you're worried that markets are overbought and will fall, don't be just yet. Based on decades of our data on thousands and thousands of stocks, 75% is when we start getting overheated, and 80% is officially overbought. The sellers come to town thereafter. It can be the next day, or weeks after, but they always come. We're not overbought yet. It also matters where the buying is happening. If buying was all utilities, telecom, and staples stocks, it shows that investors are defensive. Those are "" safe-haven "" sectors where investors look for lower volatility and higher dividend yields . It's the blankie and pacifier trade – and it's usually when the boogey-man comes. There's no boogey-man in sight because big money is buying juice. Health care saw explosive buying last week. Discretionary consumer stocks got bought bigly too. Tech and financials also saw healthy buying. www.mapsignals.com Let's dig down another layer and see what industries are juicing. We talked about software last week. It's still getting bought. Health care saw 106 buy signals. In fact, it's the biggest health care buying we've seen since summer. I wanted to see what buying like this means for the sector. I went back three years to see prior instances. The left chart shows net buys to sells for health care. If there is more buying than selling on a day, then there's a green bar. More selling means a red bar. See how it's picking up recently? The table on the right shows what happens after we see buying like this. There were 14 prior times with multiple days of 20-plus health care buy signals per day. The average forward six-month return for the Health Care Select SPDR Fund ( XLV ) was +4.3%. Of those instances, 78% (11 out of 14) were positive with an average XLV six-month gain of 6.1%. www.mapsignals.com You should know that 40% of the health care buying last week was biotech . So similarly, I wanted to look at unusually large buying in the industry group of biotechnology. The chart left is a little different than above. The green bars show periods when buying in biotech is 1.5 times bigger than average. The table on right shows the 12-month forward returns of SPDR S&P Biotech ETF ( XBI ). Of the seven times, five were positive with an average return of 5.9%. www.mapsgnals.com Often, it's better to just hear it like it is. Like when a (judge confirmed) idiot jumps the curb to avoid a school bus. Ahead of a quiet week, there is stuff going on we need to know. Buyers are here, and I expect higher prices. When we overheat will be the time to lighten up risk. Keep it simple. Like Einstein wisely said: ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."" The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
Why Foreign Blue Chips Will Crush U.S. Rivals in Decade Ahead,"The S&P 500 Index has posted a 365% gain since the bear market bottom in March 2009, and that has many investors and market historians expecting sharply lower returns ahead. Meanwhile, a study by Research Affiliates indicates that investors should tilt from U.S. to international equities for the next decade, according to a report in Barron's . Research Affiliates is the investment advisory firm founded by Rob Arnott, known for developing smart beta investing strategies. During the next decade, they forecast an average annual inflation-adjusted real return of 5.3% for the MSCI EAFE Index , which captures developed market equities in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East, and a 7.3% average real return for emerging markets stocks. By contrast, they expect annual real returns of just 0.5% for the large cap S&P 500 and 1.9% for the small cap Russell 2000 Index . Key Takeaways The next decade is likely to see meager returns on U.S. stocks. Many foreign markets are much cheaper, and have significant upside. However, foreign stocks have their own sets of risks. Significance For Investors The Russell 2000 has yet to regain its late August 2018 record high, and currently trades about 9% lower. Prior to the Russell's year-end selloff in 2018, Research Affiliates expected it to perform about as poorly as the S&P 500 going forward. With interest rates now near historic lows, Research Affiliates expects that the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index will return a negative 0.3% per year, while U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) will return a mere 0.4% annually. Real estate will be a disappointing investment as well, with REITs delivering an annualized real return of just 1%. Most REIT indexes are up by about 25% in 2019, posting gains similar to the S&P 500. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer (CIO) for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, also suggests that investors look abroad for better equity returns, per another Barron's report. She notes that the MSCI Europe Total Return Index, priced in euros, has outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return Index during the past 12 months. Moreover, in the U.S., stock valuations are high and earnings growth has diminished. By contrast, Shalett observes that valuations abroad are much lower, to the point where they are ""washed out."" Anticipating that global economic growth may rebound, partly due to easing by central banks, she writes, “The pay-off from this type of positioning [i.e., rotating from U.S. to international stocks] could be large as non-US markets are inherently more cyclical in their composition and thus more operationally leveraged to improvements in global growth."" Other investment professionals have similar observations. “Stocks are significantly cheaper in other parts of the world,” as Bill Stone, co-chief investment officer at wealth management firm Avalon Advisors in Houston, told The Wall Street Journal . “Based on current valuation levels, which help play a role in determining equity returns over the next several years, foreign markets appear more attractive than U.S. markets,” notes Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial Group-HighTower Advisors in Connecticut, per the same Journal report. Looking Ahead Foreign stocks come with their own sets of risks and caveats. There are serious political and economic troubles even in the developed world. For example, the European Union (EU) is contending with a new populist government in Italy and Brexit is still a much-delayed work in process that continues to spawn uncertainties across the continent."
"Stocks Break Higher, and Small Caps Lead the Charge","Market Moves Market indexes jumped higher early in the session and didn't give back their gains to end the day. While the S&P 500 ( SPX ), Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and Dow Jones Industrial ( DJX ) indexes all surged higher, it was the small- and micro-cap indexes that showed the most dramatic movements by far. This coordinated move higher in the indexes that also coincides with a significant number of new highs is a highly bullish indication. The chart below shows how iShares' index-tracking ETFs for both the Russell 2000 ( IWM ) and the Russell Microcap ( IWC ) closed over 2% higher and posted their highest close in the past six months. This kind of price action should drive shrewd chart watchers to drill deeper into the small-cap stock ranks to see which stocks are the strongest drivers of the move. Such top-down analysis activity is a valuable way to uncover the best candidates for momentum or relative-strength-based investing. Top Three Small-Cap Stocks on a Tear Looking deeper into the top three holdings in IWM, the strength of these stocks is easily apparent. These stocks have returned 20% to 70% gains in just the past six months. This is an impressive performance, but the breakout signal from the index today indicates that this level of performance may continue. Relative strength studies often suggest that stocks that have outperformed well over a given time frame are likely to continue to perform well over that same time frame going forward. Stocks with such strong performance are worth a closer look. Read more: Morgan Stanley's Top Picks as Growth Shifts to Emerging Markets Biotech Stocks Awaken From Long Slumber NVIDIA Stock Tests Key Level on Post-Earnings Strength Teledoc Flashes a Warning Signal One stock among these three top holdings, Teledoc Health, Inc. ( TDOC ), bears a closer look. While the performance is strong, the stock shows an underlying weakness in the volume signal. The chart below shows how the stock is breaking out to higher price levels on lower volume. This action often implies that the stock's investors will not have enough continued interest to push the stock higher in a sustained upward trend. This is underscored by a comparison between the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI). These two indicators share the same calculation with only one variation: the MFI is weighted for volume. This variation between the indexes shows that the MFI tracks much lower than the RSI, giving traders and investors alike a warning that this breakout action may not last. The Bottom Line Stocks are off to the races as indexes broke out of the gate in today's session, making new highs. The small-cap indexes showed the strongest and most notable performance. This is a bullish indication for stocks in general. Among small-cap stocks that broke out, Teledoc Health shows a subtle pattern of weakness.

UTRN: The ETF That Bets on Losers,"The Vesper U.S. Large Cap Short-Term Reversal Strategy ETF ( UTRN ) uses a proprietary methodology to create an equal-weighted portfolio, rebalanced weekly, containing the 25 stocks in the S&P 500 Index that endured sharp declines in the prior week, but which have the potential for big rebounds in the following week. The theory behind UTRN has some broad similarities with the Dogs of the Dow and the buy-on-the-dip trading systems, which also are based on expectations that beaten-down stocks will recover. The UTRN ETF is up by 29.7% year-to-date through Nov. 25, versus 25.0% for the S&P 500. Launched in Sept. 2018, it is based on an index that was backtested to 2006, beating the S&P 500 in 11 of the last 13 years, while averaging more than double the return of the S&P 500, CNN reports. Key Takeaways The UTRN ETF selects stocks likely to rebound from short-term drops. Its portfolio , drawn from the S&P 500, is rebalanced weekly. Its algorithm roughly doubled the S&P 500's return from 2006 onwards. Significance for Investors ""Negative news is contagious, many sell-offs are overdone, entire sectors can be oversold,"" per UTRN sponsor Vesper Capital Management . They note that the concept of ""short term reversal"" behind this ETF is based on research since 1965, especially 25 years of ""testing, simulations, and quantitive research"" by Professor Victor Chow of the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University. A proprietary algorithm, the Chow Ratio, drives the stock selection process used by UTRN. The 25 stocks selected from the S&P 500 each week by applying the Chow Ratio also form the Vesper U.S. Large Cap Short-Term Reversal Index (UTRNX) that is calculated by S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""Short-term stock prices often reflect investor behavioral biases such as overreaction to information, loss-aversion, and other cognitive errors as well as emotional bias,"" Professor Chow writes . Elaborating on his methodology, he adds: ""Instead of using traditional fundamental analysis or asset pricing modeling approach...[the Chow Ratio] simultaneously measures the return-stability (the health) and potential return-reversal,"" ""There is a human bias towards loss aversion. People overreact to negative information and sell stocks too fast following negative news. The overreaction causes prices to go down too much and set up the potential for a near-term rebound,"" Chow told CNN. UTRN has an expense ratio of 0.75%, much higher than passively-managed ETFs, but this is roughly in line with many actively-managed funds. Assets under management (AUM) are $35.2 million. While the Dogs of the Dow system, as usually applied, involves an annual portfolio rebalancing, the UTRN ETF portfolio is reset weekly, as noted above. Professor Chow notes that significant declines in transaction costs recently made his approach economic, and he limited his algorithm to the large cap S&P 500 because these are generally the most liquid stocks. Looking Ahead As always, the past performance of an investment strategy is no guarantee of its future returns. Moreover, although the UTRN methodology was backtested to 2006, and thus includes the last bear market, most of that period was during a long bull market. Whether UTRN will continue to outperform during the next bear market is an open question."
10 ‘Stellar’ Growth Stocks for a ‘Range-Bound’ Bull Market,"The decade-long bull market is set to continue through early 2020 on the back of a durable profit cycle and ongoing economic expansion , but will be tempered by rising political and policy uncertainty. While that uncertainty is likely to dissipate following the outcome of the presidential election, it will serve to keep the S&P 500 range-bound for most of the next year, according to Goldman Sachs’ recent 2020 U.S. Equity Outlook. In that context, investors will want to focus on growth at a reasonable price, or GARP. Ten stocks that fit that profile include Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ), MGM Resorts International ( MGM ), Lowe’s Companies Inc. ( LOW ), American Express Co. ( AMX ), Travelers Companies Inc. ( TRV ), Deere & Co. ( DE ), Raytheon Co. ( RTN ), Sempra Energy ( SRE ), CBRE Group Inc. ( CBRE ), and Varian Medical Systems Inc. ( VAR ). Key Takeaways Bull market is set to continue through 2020. Stock rise will be tempered by political and policy uncertainty. Economy remains supportive of growth stocks in the medium term. Goldman suggests growth stocks with non-extreme valuations. S&P 500 could rise 8.3% to 3400 by end of 2020. What It Means for Investors Goldman expects the S&P 500 to rise to 3250 in the early part of 2020, implying a 3.5% upside from Tuesday’s close. For investors looking how to play that modest rise, Goldman screened for stocks within the Russell 1000 index that satisfy a variety of growth and valuation metrics. Specifically, the GARP stock screener returned 47 different stocks whose growth profiles are above average and whose valuations are middle of the pack, neither extremely elevated nor extremely discounted. Growth was the main criterion by which Goldman’s GARP filter was constructed, reflecting the bank’s outlook that the U.S. economy remains supportive of growth stocks in the medium term. Stocks that ranked in the top 20% of their sector’s growth metric made the list. The growth metric was based on averages of past and predicted future sales and EPS growth, and on long-term expected growth. But because past data shows that growth stocks with extremely elevated valuations rarely grow enough to justify those valuations, the GARP screen excludes stocks ranking among the top 20% of their sector’s valuation metric. That metric is based on a variety of valuation multiples including P/E and EV/Sales ratios, as well as on free cash flow yield . Stocks ranking in the bottom 20% of valuations are also excluded in order to avoid “ value traps ”, stocks that only look cheap but whose fundamentals make it a risky bet. The sector that received the highest weighting from the screen, at 23%, was the Industrials sector. Deere & Co. is expected to see EPS and sales growth in 2020 of 11% and 3%, respectively, while Raytheon is expected to see 10% and 7% growth in EPS and sales, respectively. Both stocks trade at 17x forward earnings , slightly below the 18x forward multiple of both the Russell 1000 and the median of Goldman’s complete, 47-stock list. The Consumer Discretionary sector had the second highest weighting at 21%. MGM Resorts is expected to see EPS and sales growth in 2020 of 144% and 2%, respectively, while Lowe’s can expect EPS and sales growth of 17% and 3%, respectively. MGM trades at 22x forward earnings while Lowe’s at 18x forward earnings, according to Goldman’s report, published on November 25. Looking Ahead Goldman’s base case prediction is that the S&P 500 rises to 3400 through the end of 2020, but that prediction rests on an election outcome in which the federal government is divided. That matters because, historically, elections that result in divided governments have generally been followed by equity returns that exceed those where an election results in a single party dominating the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives."
Next New High,"Market Moves Markets pushed to new historic highs today on the large-cap indexes, while small-cap indexes pulled back from yesterday's surge. The S&P 500 ( SPX ), Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and Dow Jones Industrial ( DJX ) indexes all notched about 0.2% higher closes on light volume. Yet another bullish indication for the coming months appeared as the Volatility Index ( VIX ) for the S&P 500 closed at a new 52-week low level. The chart below compares the movements of the VIX and State Street's S&P 500 tracking ETF ( SPY ), to show why it is no surprise that the VIX should make a new low since SPY has broken above old highs for the past two weeks. The real question to ponder is why it took so long. This chart, quite simply, shows the effect of elevated concerns in the market over the past few months. Whether it be the U.S.-China trade talks, the impeachment testimony, the Fed repo actions and rate cuts, or concerns about Brexit, the market has no end of reasons to worry. Today's break lower on the VIX is an indication that investors are willing to continue investing despite such worries. Do Turkey Producer Stocks Imply Consumers Are Eating Out? With Thanksgiving Day just a stones throw away, U.S. families will soon be making that trip over the river and through the woods to sit down and feast. But will they do so at Grandma's house or Grandma's roadside restaurant? If stock price charts have the ability tell this story, the answer appears to be the latter. Seaboard Corporation ( SEB ), Hormel Foods Corporation ( HRL ), and The Kraft Heinz Company ( KHC ) are three of the bigger, publicly traded companies that produce turkey meat in one form or another. But 2019 has not been particularly kind to these stocks. On the other hand, Sysco Corporation ( SYY ) is doing quite well, outpacing the consumer staples sector in general. Sysco is a supplier to nearly 75% of all of the independent, locally famous, non-chain restaurants in the country, and a producer and distributor of Turkey products themselves. By this data alone, it makes one wonder if more people than ever before are willing to forego the holiday food prep and pay someone else to clean up afterward.

Against the better judgement of those who think the market is teetering on the edge of disaster, this data seems to indicate that the economy may continue chugging along. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, in her speech at the New York Association for Business Economics award ceremony, claimed that this data was evidence that the Fed rate cuts were already having an impact. It's hard to hate the idea of investing with data and opinion like that flowing around. The Bottom Line Stocks closed slightly higher today, and volatility broke to a notably low level. Despite noisy market issues in the news, investors seem to be willing to continue keeping assets in the stock market. Turkey consumers may be willing to eat out for Thanksgiving if Sysco Corporation's stock is any indication in comparison to other turkey producers. New home sales data was stronger than ever, a very bullish indication. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
The Black Friday Indicator,"Historical Market Moves on Black Friday Although post-Thanksgiving-Day shopping has been a recognized phenomenon since the 1950s, the first time the term ""Black Friday"" appeared in print, used as a shopping-day reference, was in 1966. Maybe 1965 was an especially frenetic year for shoppers since it was the first year that G.I. Joe became a sought-after Christmas gift. That toy went on to account for more than 50% of Hasbro, Inc.'s ( HAS ) revenue that year and the next, so that seems like it might be a good year to start tracking results of the stock market's performance on Black Friday. The stock market's performance on that day, which typically operates on an abbreviated session schedule, has never been thought to be particularly noteworthy, but perhaps it should be. When you consider that the only people who trade that day must really want to, you have to wonder whether that particular group of participants has any kind of bias to activities. What follows here is an attempt to determine whether the day's performance each year since 1965 holds any information that differs in comparison to everyday trading results. The first observation that jumps out from reviewing the charts of the S&P 500 index ( SPX ) is the frequency with which the day tends to close higher compared to the previous session's close on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. This occurs an eyebrow-lifting 70% of the time. For comparison, State Street's S&P 500 index-tracking ETF ( SPY ), has closed higher 53% of all days throughout the past 26 years since its inception. The Black Friday Indication While this day does tend to close higher more often than random results might suggest, another observation is that the relative change of the index may be an indicator of how the rest of that particular year will turn out. If the market closes in positive territory, but only mildly so, then this indication has historically not boded well for the remainder of the year's performance. The figure below specifies the return of the S&P 500 from Black Friday through the end of December for each year where the index closed positive but with a gain of less than 0.3%. The average return for the final weeks of those years is a 0.28% loss. That's not particularly inviting. However, when the day closes higher or lower than this range, the results become more interesting. Neutral days Read more: The Best Black Friday Deals Black Friday Shopping: The 9 Worst Items to Buy 5 Best States for Black Friday Shopping Trading the Black Friday Indication It turns out that if Black Friday closes more than 0.3% higher compared to the previous Wednesday's close, the returns for the remainder of the year have been a good bit more desirable. The figure below gives the detail. The average return of the final weeks of these years is over 1.5% (more than double the average monthly gain for the index). However, a more surprising result occurs when the markets actually close lower for the day. In those years, the market actually gains even more ground in its closing weeks (the detail is shown in the second figure below). The average return for years when Black Friday trades down from the previous day is nearly 2.5%. A cautionary note is that, although the majority of these years trade positively, the down years are the worst of any recorded since 1965. Positive days Negative days The Bottom Line Comparing the one-day performance of the S&P 500 index as it trades on Black Friday may be a useful indicator of trading activity through the end of the year. Diligent researchers will notice that the sample size of this data is perhaps too small for any conclusions to be robust. However, the persistence of positive returns compared to an average trading day suggests that there may be something worth studying about the participation of traders on Black Friday.

Value ETFs Poised to Resume Uptrend,"After a decade of underwhelming returns, value stocks – equities that trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals – have made somewhat of a resurgence in late 2019. Over the past three months, this cohort of stocks has outperformed its growth counterpart by about 3%. Some market commentators attribute the comeback in value indexes versus growth indexes to sector performance. R.W. Baird analysts Willie Delwiche told MarketWatch last month that a rebound in beaten-down cyclical sectors , such as financials and materials, has contributed to value stocks' recent comeback as investors rotate into undervalued names on hopes that global economic growth has steadied and that the United States and China will sign off on a meaningful trade agreement. Other investment managers, like AQR Capital Management founder Cliff Asness, argue that value stocks have become attractive because they have fallen due to price moves rather than fundamentals over the past two years, which makes them cheaper, per Barron's . Those who want to position for value stocks to resume their recent outperformance should add these three value exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to their watchlist . Below, we take a closer look at the specifics of each fund and analyze the charts to identify possible trading opportunities. Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value ETF (RPV) With assets under management (AUM) of $890.89 million, the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value ETF ( RPV ) seeks to provide similar returns to the S&P 500 Pure Value Index. The 13-year-old fund uses three ratios to select large-capitalization value stocks: price-to-book (P/B ratio), price-to-earnings (P/E ratio), and price-to-sales (P/S ratio). Not surprisingly, financial and consumer cyclical names feature strongly, with the sectors receiving respective asset percentage allocations of 33.48% and 16.91%. The ETF, which charges a 0.35% management fee, holds blue-chip bellwether companies such as Ford Motor Company ( F ), Valero Energy Corporation ( VLO ), and MetLife, Inc. ( MET ). Nearly 200,000 shares change hands daily on an average 0.03% spread to keep trading costs low. As of Dec. 2, 2019, RPV issues a 2.44% dividend yield and has gained almost 15% over the past three months. Year to date (YTD), the fund has returned 22.40%. RPV shares spent the middle part of this year oscillating within a well-defined seven-point trading range . Price started to gain momentum in October before finally breaking above the range's top trendline on heavy volume in early November. More recently, the fund has consolidated in a tight flag pattern, indicating upside continuation. Traders can set a profit objective by measuring the distance of the leg higher that proceeded the flag and add that amount to the pattern's breakout point. ($7.29 + $68.50 = $75.79 profit target). Protect capital with a stop-loss order positioned just below $66. StockCharts.com iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE) The iShares Edge MSCI USA Value Factor ETF ( VLUE ) aims to provide investment results that generally correspond to the MSCI USA Enhanced Value Index. The benchmark selects undervalued large- and mid-cap stocks based on fundamental metrics, including earnings, revenue , book value, and cash earnings. Technology commands the top sector allocation at 23.10%, while prominent single stock weightings include AT&T Inc. ( T ) at 9.08%, Intel Corporation ( INTC ) at 8.42%, and International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) at 3.46%. The $3.88 billion fund suits all trading strategies with its narrow two-cent spread and active daily dollar volume liquidity of over $30 million. As of Dec. 2, 2019, VLUE charges a low annual management fee of 0.15% and has returned 16.14% over the past three months. Investors also receive a 2.70% dividend yield. The ETF's share price broke above a six-month ascending channel in early November and has traded within a tight $2 range since. As the fund trades near its all-time high, consider using a trailing stop to let profits run as far as possible. To do this, place an initial stop order below last month's consolidation at $86.02 and lift it under each higher swing low that forms. Conservative traders may decide to wait for a breakout above current resistance at $88 before taking an entry. StockCharts.com iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF (EFV) The iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF ( EFV ) offers a cost-effective instrument for traders who want exposure to international value equities by tracking the MSCI EAFE Value Index. Japan and the United Kingdom dominate country percentage allocations at 25.40% and 22.38%, respectively. However, the ETF also provides ample coverage of value stocks listed in France, Germany, and Australia. Some of the better-known companies in the fund's portfolio of nearly 500 holdings include Japanese car maker Toyota Motor Corporation ( TM ), global investment bank HSBC Holdings plc ( HSBC ), and British multinational oil and gas giant BP p.l.c. ( BP ). A trading volume of 500,000 shares per day, coupled with a narrow penny spread and competitive 0.38% expense ratio , makes the fund a swing trader's favorite in the segment. EFV controls net assets of $5.41 billion, yields a healthy 4.11%, and has jumped 11.50% over the past three months as of Dec. 2, 2019. A breakout above an established trendline in mid-October fueled a rally to a new 52-week high at $50.17. Over the past month, however, the price has paused and consolidated within a flag pattern, which appears to be finding support near the April swing high at the $49 level. Those who buy here should anticipate a move to $52.70, where the fund encounters crucial overhead resistance from a long-term horizontal line. Implement risk management by placing a stop order under the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). StockCharts.com"
Real Estate ETFs Bounce From Key Support,"A recent pullback in real estate exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provides an opportunity for swing traders to join the momentum in one of this year's better-performing sectors. Most funds that track the group invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are companies that own and operate real estate to generate income. REITs look well posited to keep performing into 2020 provided economic growth remains stable and the Fed keeps interest rates comparatively low. A healthy economy ensures that landlords can keep gradually increasing rent, while access to cheap money through lower rates helps real estate owners service property debt. Moreover, given that REITs pass 90% of their net earnings to investors in the form of dividends , they become more appealing when bond yields fall. While e-commerce and high-profile mall anchor bankruptcies have undoubtedly taken their toll on retail REITs, the growing need for logistics infrastructure and fulfillment centers to satisfy online order demand continues to create opportunities. Furthermore, the rise in cloud computing , the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) bodes well for third-party telecommunication infrastructure and data-center REITs. Those who want to buy the dip in real estate REIT ETFs should consider the three funds outlined below. Let's review the metrics of each and work through several trading possibilities. Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull 3X Shares (DRN) With assets under management (AUM) of $64.77 million, the Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull 3X Shares ( DRN ) aims to return three times the daily performance of the MSCI US IMI Real Estate 25/50 Index. The benchmark comprises both large- and small-cap REITs and stipulates that all allocations with a weighting above 5% cannot exceed 50% of the index. DRN, through its leveraged exposure, provides a suitable instrument for those who want to take an aggressive short-term bet on the U.S. real estate market. Traders should consider using limit orders to combat the fund's wider 0.43% average spread and sometimes sluggish share turnover. While the ETF's 1.04% expense ratio sits on the pricey side, it doesn't overly affect active trading. As of Nov. 27, 2019, the fund offers a 1.59% dividend yield and has gained 72.21% year to date (YTD). Since the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossed above the 200-day SMA in early March to generate a "" golden cross ,"" buy signal, DRN shares have continued to trend steadily higher. Over the past nine months, pullbacks to the dotted blue trendline have provided solid support . Therefore, November's retracement to this closely watched trendline offers swing traders a high-probability entry point. Those who take a position should place a stop-loss order beneath the Nov. 23 low at $28 and think about taking profits near the 52-week high at $32.43. StockCharts.com ProShares Ultra Real Estate (URE) The ProShares Ultra Real Estate ( URE ) has an objective to provide two times the daily return of the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. The fund's underlying index consists of companies and REITs that invest in residential, apartments, office, and retail properties. Trading wise, daily dollar volume liquidity of over $1 million coupled with an average dime spread makes the 12-year-old ETF a suitable choice for those looking to take a geared bet on U.S. real estate. Traders should note that the fund's rebalancing mechanism makes returns for greater than one day unpredictable due to the effects of compounding . URE controls net assets of $151.56 million, charges a 0.95% management fee, and sports a YTD gain of around 50% as of Nov. 27, 2019. The fund yields 1.05%. The URE share price has remained in an orderly uptrend since March, with the 50-day SMA and a trendline providing a floor for the majority of recent dips. This month's retracement to the still-in-play trendline also finds added support from the June and July swing highs in the form of previous resistance now becoming support. Traders who buy at current levels should set a stop order somewhere below $82.50 and aim to lock in profits on a move that represents at least two times risk. For instance, those who use a $4.10 stop (the difference between Tuesday's $86.60 closing price and $82.50) should set a profit target near $94.80. StockCharts.com iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) Launched back in 2000, the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF ( IYR ) tracks the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index, offering traders a vanilla unleveraged instrument for following the sector. Within the REIT space, the $4.7 billion fund tilts toward specialized, residential, and retail properties, with respective percentage allocations of 31.55%, 14.72%, and 11.20%. Cell tower owner American Tower Corporation ( AMT ) takes the top stock weighting at 7.50%. Traders enjoy tight penny spreads and ample liquidity, with more than 6 million shares exchanging hands per day. As of Nov. 27, 2019, IYR issues a 2.57% dividend yield and has returned 25.53% on the year. By comparison, the average S&P 500 company has gained 25.28% and yields 1.88%. As IYR tracks the same underlying index as URE, both charts look remarkably similar. This month's second tag of the uptrend line that has been in play since the first quarter allows traders to enter the stock on a countertrend move. The relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading well below overbought territory, providing ample room for the price to test higher prices before consolidating. Because the fund charges a lower management fee, consider using a trailing stop to let profits run. To apply this exit technique, place an initial stop under the November swing low and raise it under each successive ascending trough. StockCharts.com"
Buying in Stocks Is Nearing Overbought Levels,"Check this out: researchers taught rats how to gamble. These rats learned to ""play it safe,"" and they maximized their winnings. They were focused winner-rats. Guess what happened when researchers introduced flashing lights and sounds? The rats changed. They abandoned their conservative logic and went for high-risk, high-reward instead. You can read about that here . The first thought that came to me wasn't Vegas – it was the market. You know I habitually trash CNBC, and I'm going to do it again now. Years ago, financial news looked bland and stuffy, with old dudes sometimes sporting bow-ties. Well nowadays, it looks more like a casino: flashing lights, buttons, loud noises, and sometimes utter nonsense. Investing is like the strategic rat. But media, brokers, and tipsters prefer it like a casino. They want everyone to abandon logic and ""go for it!"" It's better for business. TV needs viewers to see their ads. Advertisers pay the networks based on viewers, and boring doesn't cut it. Brokers need you to trade. They need your commissions. Even the no-fee brokers need you to trade to sell your order flow to the highest bidder. The more you trade, the better they feel. They need risky-trader rats. I know I'm a broken record, but I believe that the truth lies in the data. I measure the market based on big money moving in and out. The biggest investors buying and selling massive amounts of stock not only dictate where the market is, but where it's headed. That's why my day isn’t filled with TVs, ticker tapes, flashing lights, and buzzers. I gave that up years ago. And I have been way more focused ever since. What the data says now is that buyers are plowing into risk. They are buying stocks at an exciting pace. Last week was an ordinarily slow holiday week – well, on the surface it was. But reality saw huge buying. We saw big accumulation in health care, financials, real estate, and consumer staples . Tech also saw nice buying along with industrials. www.mapsignals.com Health care continues to be the hottest sector going right now. I noted this uptick in health care buying in late October, and it has ripped ever since. Look at this chart showing Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLV ) mapped against Mapsignals net buy and sell signals. More buying on a day means green bars. More selling means red bars. XLV rallied more than 8% since the uptick was noted. www.mapsignals.com Last week, health care buying kept on trucking. We saw 118 buy signals. What's interesting is that most of this buying, 89 signals, came in biotech . That has been the theme of health care for the past month: big money loves biotech. www.mapsignals.com Tech and financials also saw big buying last week. Those sectors continue their run higher: www.mapsignals.com But the real story lies under the surface. As you see in the little table above, software saw 55 buy signals. That buying was really split between tech and financials. Software stocks have been getting bought in style since the late September clobbering. This next chart shows when we see prolonged periods of software buying. The green is when buying is more than 1.5 times usual levels. It usually means higher prices ahead. This is mapped against the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ). www.mapsignals.com So, as the pundits on TV debate impeachment, North Korean missile firings, Ebola, and the endless list of Democratic candidates, they paint an undertone of fear. They fuel the bearish view of the market. The data is quite different – it says that investors want stocks. They want them badly. That's the good news. The bad news is that buying like this can't happen forever. The Mapsignals Big Money Index (BMI) lifted to 74.6%. This means that, over the past 25 days, 74.6% of all signals were buys. That's a kiss away from being ""overheated"" at 75%. That's when the needle is in the yellow. A BMI level of 80% is overbought , and that has a strong history of predicting pullbacks in the market. www.mapsignals.com All this really means is proceed with caution. This is not the time to get caught up in the fervor and jump in. It means: don't become the rat drunk off noise and lights. That becomes a high-risk proposition. The time to buy was weeks ago. That said, if you're long, stay that way and perhaps look for areas to trim risk in the coming weeks. You may have a profit you're targeting to take or a trade that came back to flat. When the market becomes overbought, it is the time to reduce risk like that, but I just wouldn't be adding new risk right now. The market will likely pull back and offer a better entry. Make no mistake though: I am still bullish on stocks. Rates are low, earnings are great, profits are high, and there is still boatloads of cash out there waiting. Be a smart rat: maximize your winnings. Because as W. C. Fields says: ""The clever cat eats cheese and breathes down rat holes with baited breath."" The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
Profit Takers Abound as Stocks Pull Back,"Market Moves The major stock market indexes retreated today in the most significant pullback in prices over the past two months. The S&P 500 ( SPX ), Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), Dow Jones Industrial ( DJX ), and Russell 2000 ( RUT ) all dropped by about 1%. It isn't surprising that investors, coming out of the long weekend, felt the need to take profits. However, market watchers may find it instructive to consider just what news might have triggered the selling. This could help to gauge whether the current price action is a temporary dip in prices or the beginning of a new downward trend. Two particular communications appear to be at the crux of the market's moves. The first is that Christine Lagarde, the new president of the European Central Bank (ECB), speaking before members of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, explained why her predecessors had such a difficult time reviving economic growth despite their best efforts. The problem, she explained, is that ""the world economy outlook remains sluggish and uncertain. This lowers demand for euro area goods and services and also affects business sentiment and investment."" As a solution, she offered that the ECB could ""respond effectively even when growth is being dampened by external factors ... by ensuring favorable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy and providing visibility on those conditions into the future."" She expressed her belief that, ""backed by a steady flow of credit on affordable terms, households and firms can consume and invest more."" When the new president of the ECB suggests that she really wants to help banks get a steady flow of credit going, you can't be surprised if investors get interested. On the other side of the Atlantic, a comment on Fox news regarding how President Trump will raise tariffs if no China deal occurs sent U.S. stocks lower at the thought of the prospect. These two ideas in juxtaposition easily explain the market's atypical reaction in sending the euro significantly higher and simultaneously driving U.S. stocks significantly lower. Market Anticipates More European Growth Beginning with this hypothesis that the market may be interested in favoring those investments that benefit from more available capital in Europe, we can double check what we might find from companies that derive significant revenues from that region. The chart below shows an intraday comparison of such companies including DuPont de Nemours, Inc. ( DD ), Deere & Company ( DE ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ), 3M Company ( MMM ), International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ), and Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ). Unsurprisingly, most of these companies performed better than their benchmark, the S&P 500 index as tracked by State Street's index-tracking ETF ( SPY ).

Staunch contrarian investors would likely be interested in looking at precious metals investments at this time. Both gold and silver prices closed mildly higher in today's trading session. The chart below compares State Street's Gold Trust ETF ( GLD ) and iShares Silver Trust ETF ( SLV ) with four companies in this industry group including Hecla Mining Company ( HL ), Eldorado Gold Corporation ( EGO ), Royal Gold, Inc. ( RGLD ), Newmont Goldcorp Corporation ( NEM ), and Barrick Gold Corporation ( ABX ). The price action shows the lower priced stocks in this group beginning to surge higher. If S&P 500 prices continue to tumble, it's a good bet that these stocks will continue to rise higher. The Bottom Line Stocks fell by 1% today as opinions that President Trump will raise tariffs seemed to inspire selling. Christine Lagarde's comments that the ECB should help banks extend credit even further helped attract money away from U.S. stocks and toward the euro instead of the U.S. dollar. Precious metals also seemed to benefit from this dynamic. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Where to Buy Booming Biotech ETFs,"Biotechnology stocks – as measured by one the industry's mainstay exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF ( XBI ) – have outperformed the S&P 500 by around 8% over the past three months. Interestingly, the group's bullish run that kicked off in early October roughly coincided with the sixth week in a row in which biotech funds saw withdrawals exceed inflows, according to research conducted by Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond, as reported by Barron's . As the melt-up in biotechs has continued in recent weeks, outflows haven't slowed. ""This is the 12th week of outflows in the past 14 weeks for the sector , during which time net outflows have totaled $3.5 billion,"" Raymond wrote in a client note in late November, per a follow-up Barron's story. Despite money bleeding from this highly speculative sector, several positive developments in the fourth quarter provide plausible explanations for the recent run-up. Firstly, Massachusetts drug maker Biogen Inc. ( BIIB ) has surged 26% since the start of October on news that the company had decided to submit an experimental Alzheimer's disease medicine for regulatory approval. Meanwhile, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation for a breakthrough prostate cancer therapy, along with rumors of a possible multi-billion-dollar acquisition of The Medicines Company ( MDCO ) by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG ( NVS ), have also helped create industry buzz over the period. Below, we take a more detailed look at XBI and two other biotechnology ETFs before turning to the charts to identify high-probability entry points. SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) With an asset pool of $3.74 billion, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF has an objective to track the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index – an equal-weighted benchmark of U.S. biotechnology stocks. Leading names in the fund's basket of 116 holdings include Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( ARWR ), The Medicines Company, and Seattle Genetics, Inc. ( SGEN ). A middling 0.35% expense ratio makes midterm holds workable, while daily turnover of nearly 5 million shares and an average two-cent spread allow traders to go after intraday moves. XBI offers a tiny 0.02% dividend yield and has added 16.53% over the past three months as of Dec. 3, 2019. It saw outflows of $37.5 million in November. The ETF's share price traded within a textbook descending channel between April and October before breaking above the pattern's top trendline and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in early November. Given that the relative strength index (RSI) flashes an overbought reading, traders should look for a pullback opportunity. Think about placing a buy limit order around $83.50, where price finds a confluence of support from the upper channel line, 200-day SMA, and key 50% Fibonacci retracement level. StockCharts.com Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF (PBE) The Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF ( PBE ), which had a November outflow of $7.83 million, aims to provide similar investment results to the Dynamic Biotech & Genome Intellidex Index. As the name of the underlying index suggests, the fund invests in companies primarily involved in biotechnology and genetic engineering . Biogen takes a 6.71% allocation of the ETF's assets, while its top 10 holdings account for about half of the fund's value. Although not as liquid as some of the other biotech ETFs, PBE still has an average dollar volume of $600,000 and a competitive 0.19% spread. Longer holding periods are more expensive here, with an annual management fee of 0.57%. As of Dec. 3, 2019, the fund has net assets of $224.61 million and is trading almost 11% higher over the past three months. PBE shares started their most recent leg higher in early October from the lower trendline of a descending channel. While the RSI has dipped back below overbought levels, Monday's steep drop may see more profit-taking in subsequent trading sessions . Those looking to buy the fund should consider entering near $52 – an area where price encounters solid support from the channel's top trendline, 200-day SMA, and closely watched 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level. For those wanting confirmation the uptrend has resumed, wait for a reversal, such as a hammer or bullish engulfing pattern , to form before executing a trade. StockCharts.com Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X Shares (LABU) Launched in 2015, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X Shares ( LABU ) attempts to return three times the daily performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, effectively making it a geared version of XBI. The $487.45 million fund's sizable exposure to biotechnology, medical research, and pharmaceuticals make it a suitable tactical tool for active traders who want a more aggressive bet in those areas. Some of the big pharma names in the fund's benchmark include AbbVie Inc. ( ABBV ), Celgene Corporation ( CELG ), and Amgen Inc. ( AMGN ). Like most leveraged products, the ETF's management fee isn't cheap due to the use of derivative instruments to achieve its magnified returns. More importantly, ample liquidity and narrow spreads work perfectly with the fund's short-term mission. As of Dec. 3, 2019, LABU yields 0.68% and has gained 48.25% over the past month. Outflows totaled $158.54 million in November. Since setting a 2019 low at $27.01 in early October, the ETF's share price has nearly doubled. Like the two biotech funds discussed above, price broke out from a descending channel last month and now trades just 25% below its 52-week high set in the first quarter. Instead of chasing the market , look to buy dips around $42.50, where the bulls should keep prices well bid near the support of the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and a 12-month horizontal line.

Why JPMorgan Sees 'Great Rotation' Sharply Boosting Stocks in 2020,"Despite widespread concerns about high stock valuations and trade tensions, JPMorgan predicts a ""great rotation"" by retail investors from bond funds to equity funds in 2020, the biggest such shift since 2013, MarketWatch reports. As a result, individual investors will replace institutional investors as the key drivers of stock market gains. “Given this year proved to be a strong year for equity markets, helped by institutional investors, then we should see retail investors responding to this year’s equity market strength by turning [into] big buyers of equity funds in 2020. This suggests 2020 could be another strong year for equities driven by retail rather than institutional investors,” according to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Key Takeaways JPMorgan sees stock market gains in 2020, driven by retail investors. Retail investors were cautious in 2019, and poured money into bonds. Recent history, and interest rate cuts, point to a reversal in 2020. However, the Wall Street consensus expects small gains in 2020. Significance for Investors JPMorgan notes that retail investors have taken “extremely cautious stance” in 2019, putting a brake on stock market gains. They also observe that 2012, 2017, and 2019 were the most recent years with strong flows into bond funds, and that such flows were weak in 2013 and 2018. Nonetheless, Panigirtzoglou says that a ""major challenge"" to JPMorgan's forecast is high equity allocations among retail investors. However, he adds, recent central bank rate cuts have made the yields on cash and bonds increasingly less attractive. As of Nov. 27, only 33.6% of retail investors were bullish, versus 34.2% during the prior week and the historical average of 38.0%, per the Investor Sentiment Survey by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) . Meanwhile, 30.3% were bearish, versus 29.1% a week earlier and the historical average of 30.5%. The rest were neutral. Among eight leading investment firms that had released forecasts as of Nov. 29, the average prediction is that the S&P 500 will end 2020 at 3,241, just 3.2% above its Nov. 2019 close, per The Wall Street Journal . Credit Suisse is the most bullish, at 3,425, or 9.0% above the November close. They expect strong corporate share repurchases in 2020, as well as earnings growth in the mid-single digits. The most bearish strategist is Francois Trahan of UBS, who sees the S&P 500 sinking to 2,550, or 18.8% below the November close. “There is NO debate on S&P 500 forward earnings : a contraction appears imminent,” he writes, observing ""significant slowdowns in the U.S. economy."" Looking Ahead In the short term, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, sees several factors suggesting rising U.S. stock prices in December, per his report titled "" A Favorable Finale? "" He cites growing optimism about the economy and a trade deal, upward momentum for several key market indices, plus historical precedents. ""Since 1945, the S&P 500 posted its best average return in December, along with the highest frequency of advance and lowest level of volatility,"" Stovall writes. He also notes that, from 1995 onwards, all 11 S&P sectors and 87% of 101 sub-industries within the S&P 1500 have been up, on average, in December. For 2020, Morgan Stanley's U.S. equity strategy team led by Mike Wilson are notable bears, expecting tepid U.S. economic growth and virtually no corporate earnings improvement, per their recent ""2020 Outlook"" report. They project that the S&P 500 will end 2020 at 3,000, or 4.5% below its Nov. 2019 close."
Healthy Bounce,"Market Moves Stocks continued their rebound, led by health care and financial sector stocks. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) and Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) rose by just over 0.5% on the day. The financial and health care sectors closed nearly 1% higher, however, demonstrating relative strength . Of these two sectors, the health care sector performance is more notable. When upward trending markets pause to dip, it is useful to note which sectors are rising fastest out of the recent lows. This price action belies the actions of professional fund managers as they rotate their investment choices. In an attempt to take advantage of the opportunities their research suggests, they tend to cluster their choices in what they consider more favorable industry groups or sectors. The chart below details how the health care sector, tracked by State Street's Healthcare ETF ( XLV ), has risen from the bottom of the ranking to nearly the top. This is a relatively stronger performance since Oct. 1, the start of the fourth quarter, than any of State Street's other sector ETFs including Financial ( XLF ), Technology ( XLK ), Industrial ( XLI ), Basic Materials ( XLB ), Energy ( XLE ), Staples ( XLP ), Discretionary ( XLY ), and Utilities ( XLU ). Health Care Sector Rebound Is Surprisingly Robust Another strong indication that the healthcare sector is being aggressively pursued by investment managers is the relative performance over the past 15 trading sessions. The chart below provides an interesting closeup of this action. Looking at this chart, you can see two things worthy of note: (1) the sector does not dip as low as the broader market, and (2) the sector fully retraces its pullback in only two sessions, where the broad market index has only retraced about half of its move. The importance of this is that, even after two months of strong performance, buyers are still enthusiastic about participating in this sector.

This sector has many ETFs that track the industry sectors within it. The chart below compares some of the more actively traded ones, including iShares' Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ), U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF ( IHF ), and its U.S. Medical Devices ETF ( IHI ), as well as Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Health Care ETF ( RYH ), and its SmallCap Health Care ETF ( PSCH ), and rounded out with State Street's Health Care Equipment ETF ( XHE ). Two important observations here are that the biotechnology sector is leading and that the small-cap stocks within the sector are also leading the average. This matches the move in small-cap stocks in the market at large. The Bottom Line Stocks continued to rebound today led by the financial and health care sectors. The health care sector move is impressive because it seems more robust and has the potential to continue. Within the health care sector, small-cap stocks and biotechnology stocks seem to be leading the charge, showing relative strength over the past three days.

Seasonal Hiring Companies Fail to Impress,"Market Moves Stocks closed slightly higher in a trading session that featured slightly more selling than buying. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) and Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) closed with a two-tenths percent increase, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) and the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) managed half that amount. These lackluster moves are a bit surprising considering two data points that came to light today. First, the results of the recent Black-Friday through Cyber-Monday weekend broke all time highs with a 20% increase over last year's totals. Second, unemployment claims came in well below the forecast to notch the third lowest reading in the past four years. Reading these two data points, one might expect to see a healthy consumer-driven economy powering stocks higher on such news. To be sure, the picture over a longer time frame looks exactly like that. However the close-up view may tell a different story. Consider the chart below, which compares the S&P 500 with an equal-weighted portfolio of the top five seasonal-hiring companies in 2019, including Target Corporation ( TGT ), United Parcel Service, Inc. ( UPS ), Macy's, Inc. ( M ), Kohls Corporation ( KSS ), and Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ). Since August when these companies began hiring, investors have remained unimpressed as the share prices lag the broad market average by 10% in one quarter. Chart readers might be given to wonder if these companies may have over-recruited. Social Media Companies Maintain Battle for User Attention 2020 figures to be a wild and woolly election year, with the battle for political allegiance taking deliberate shape on the social media platforms first and foremost. With that in mind, it might be prudent for investors to consider which companies appear to be having the most success in that arena. With Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) controlling YouTube and Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) controlling LinkedIn, the four companies shown in the chart below are worth comparing. If market valuation is any indication of such things, this chart declares Facebook, Inc. ( FB ) the winner and Twitter, Inc. ( TWTR ) the loser. Read more: 3 Tax Selling Candidates for December Buying in Stocks Is Nearing Overbought Levels Traders Turn Bullish on Communication Services Sector A Highly Paid CEO may Hurt Shareholders Being overconfident and accepting overly optimistic sales projections thus leading to problems with over-staffed payrolls is only one of the ways a CEO can mismanage a company's resources. Board members may understand that they take a risk when they agree to high compensation packages tied less to performance and stock price than simple salaries and bonuses, but shareholders seem to be even more aware of it. Consider the following chart which compares the share performance of the companies that have the top ten highest-paid (not including stock and options) CEOs among publicly traded companies. This list includes J2 Global, Inc. ( JCOM ), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. ( PANW ), Discovery, Inc. ( DISCA ), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. ( EL ), Tesla, Inc. ( TSLA ), T-Mobile US, Inc. ( TMUS ), The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ), PTC Inc. ( PTC ) and Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) which has two entries on the list. To be sure these CEOs have had success most of us would dream of; however, while the average growth company has doubled in value over the past five years, these companies have lagged behind that performance. The Bottom Line Stocks inched higher on lackluster results despite great news from retail sales reports and reduced unemployment claims. Social media companies will battle for a stronger consumer base in the year to come, and companies with over-compensated CEOs may not perform so well if the past five years are any indication.

Hanging On: Stocks Catch Support,"Market Moves Stocks seemed to find a toehold to keep from sliding off a cliff as the broad market indexes gapped down to start the session but closed higher than they opened. The S&P 500 ( SPX ), Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), Dow Jones Industrial ( DJX ) and the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) dropped between 0.5% and 1% on the day, but it was the shape of the trading that should capture the attention of traders and investors. The salient question for investors to ponder is whether the current market action represents a brief pause, a dip in an upward price trend, or an early warning of a coming downtrend and economic recession in 2020. While many are predicting the latter, the market is giving subtle signals that the future will more likely play out as the former. The chart below details a key point in how the S&P 500, tracked by State Street's ETF ( SPY ), showed a subtle indication that investors want to buy stocks at this price. With tariff and trade war fears causing investors to trim back their positions in stocks like Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), 3M Company ( MMM ), and Dow Inc. ( DOW ), the market didn't demonstrate much follow-through selling. The markets instead showed higher-than-usual volume for a net-positive day. Additionally, the index didn't come anywhere near its 40-day moving average before buyers were willing to step in. These indications suggest that investors are, generally speaking, not so scared of putting their money to work in the stock market. Large-cap performance Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Stocks Outperform Large Caps Another subtle indication that the markets may be ready to rebound shortly is that riskier stocks are not being sold off faster than stocks considered to be more solid investments. One could make the case that this is so today because multinational corporations (large companies) have more exposure to trade war issues. However trade war issues that affect large U.S. companies will affect the economy at large and should make investors of all stripes recoil from risk. The charts below show that, for today at least, this isn't the case. Both mid-cap stocks, as tracked by State Street's mid-cap index-tracking ETF ( MDY ), and small-cap stocks, tracked by iShares Russell 2000 ETF ( IWM ), didn't drop as far at the open and rebounded stronger on the day. Note that the entire range of IWM was fully above the previous low prices in the past month. These subtle indications show that risk-friendly investors are currently reacting quickly to opportunity in the markets. Evidence like this is frequently a bullish indication for the larger market.

If investors are willing to embrace the current moment as a market opportunity, rather than a warning signal, then the logical progression for their activity would be to look for stocks that show recent relative strength . Amgen Inc. ( AMGN ) is among the best performing large-cap stocks over the past three months. A quick look at its chart helps an investor notice that it looks remarkably stronger than the market averages right now. Given that this stock, like most biotechnology company stocks, is considered a high-risk, high-opportunity investment, it seems uncharacteristic for investors to seek it out in times of market distress. The fact that they are buoying up the stock price right now is a further bit of evidence that the current market environment is one of opportunity rather than risk. The Bottom Line Stocks fell again today but rebounded within the session to close in positive territory compared to the open. Small- and mid-cap indexes outperformed the large-cap indexes as investors tipped their hand in favor of searching for opportunity. Amgen, a biotechnology company, showed relative strength over the past two days, hinting again that investors are desperately seeking opportunity.

Energy Sector Stocks Surge Ahead,"Market Moves Stocks closed higher in response to a surprisingly strong result in the Non-Farm Payroll report. The monthly data point drove broad market indexes 1% higher on the day and brought them near to last month's historic highs. The S&P 500 ( SPX ) closed 0.9% higher, while the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ), and the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) all notched gains of greater than 1%. The labor report was released this morning before the markets opened and caused the indexes to gap up at the open. To understand just how unusually strong the data was on this report, it is worth noting that, of the 480 times this report has been given over the past two decades, the number of jobs that were created exceeded this last report only 22 times, putting this report's news in the top 5% of all such results (see chart below). It is true that this month's report included a significant amount of seasonal hiring, but comparing this month's number with all November and December reports (where seasonal hiring would be reported), only four times out of the past 40 occurrences reported higher than today. This information correlates well with the Cyber-weekend sales figures that broke records and the unemployment figure that is currently at a 50-year low of 3.5%. Energy Sector Stocks Surge Ahead When the Non-Farm Payroll report denotes continued strength in the U.S. economy, it usually has a positive impact on the U.S. dollar, as investors assume that their money will find both more safety and opportunity being put to work in that kind of an economy. That is how things worked out today as the greenback rose significantly against the euro and other currencies. When the U.S. dollar increases in value, it is mathematically expected that anything an investor could buy with U.S. dollars will go down in value. Astute investors therefore look for exceptions to this rule in order to find signals of unusual demand or supply. One particular exception stood out today in the price of oil and oil-and-energy-related stocks. This is all the more notable because energy sector stocks have lagged significantly behind the rest of the market all year, although they have begun to rebound lately. As the price of oil rose today on news that oil inventories dropped more than expected, a significant change in energy sector stocks was to be expected. The chart below compares State Street's Energy Sector ETF ( XLE ) with the S&P 500 tracking ETF ( SPY ). The candle size underscores the fact that the energy sector increased by more than double the move in the broad market index. This sector was the only sector with such a significant move higher on the day.

Consider the following chart which compares the share performance of several companies in the sector including Halliburton Company ( HAL ), Schlumberger Limited ( SLB ), Exxon Mobil Corporation ( XOM ), Chevron Corporation ( CVX ), Enbridge Inc. ( ENB ), and Concho Resources Inc. ( CXO ). Although the biggest of these have continued to lag the market so far, the smaller companies in this group tend to be faring better. The Bottom Line Stocks notched higher, nearly completing a full retrace of the recent drop in prices. The move higher was spurred by the strong labor data reported today. Energy stocks jumped comparatively higher, with Halliburton and Concho Resources leading the way. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Why Volatility Plunging Near 20-Year Low Is Red Flag for Stocks,"2019 has been an exceptional year for equity returns, and an unusually quiet year for volatility. That may not last, according to some strategists. Mike Wilson, the chief investment officer (CIO) and head U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, says that a flood of liquidity from the Federal Reserve and other central banks, at a $1.2 trillion annual rate, has created an artificial 20-year low in volatility that is unlikely to last amid weak fundamentals. He outlined both the market risks and how investors should prepare for a volatility spike in a recent podcast ﻿ ﻿ . Key Takeaways Stocks prices are up, and volatility down, despite weak fundamentals. Massive injections of liquidity by central banks are the reason. Expectations of a recovery in 2020 are likely to be disappointed. Significance For Investors Highlights of Wilson's comments follow, as transcribed by Investopedia. ""2019 has been a year in which the fundamentals have steadily deteriorated, yet equity prices have rallied sharply, More than 100 percent of the returns in equity markets this year have come from higher valuations, while earnings growth has been negative."" ""Are stock prices simply looking forward and telling us earnings growth is going to rebound sharply next year? Maybe, but if that were the case we should be seeing other asset prices rebounding more than they are. More specifically, 10-year interest rates, commodity prices, inflation break-evens and cyclical stocks relative to defensive ones have actually rolled over recently, and in some cases sharply."" ""Instead of stocks telling us growth is going to rebound sharply next year, we simply think they are responding to something else, a massive surge in central bank balance sheet expansion. To be specific, about two months ago the Fed, the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan began expanding their balance sheets by a combined $100 billion per month. That’s a lot of liquidity, and it’s undeniable it’s having an impact on asset prices."" ""It’s definitely been a volatility suppressant. For example, over the past two months, 30-day realized volatility for the S&P 500 has plummeted, from over 21 percent to just five and a half. To put that in context, this is one of the lowest realized volatility readings in the past 20 years, the first percentile to be exact."" ""That seems like a bit of a mispricing, given the negative earnings growth we’re witnessing, and ongoing trade war and other geopolitical tensions and a full-blown recession in global manufacturing. Due to the advent of systematic investment strategies that target volatility, the lower realized volatility has led to significant inflows to equity markets that are not fundamentally based."" ""It’s also allowed, and forced, some active equity managers to hold more risk than they should, or normally would, simply because volatility is now underpriced."" ""This is masking what’s really on with the fundamentals, and convincing many analysts, strategists, and even companies of a recovery next year that’s likely to disappoint now-high expectations. We’re not sure when this disappointment will manifest itself in the form of higher volatility, but we’re highly confident volatility is about as low as it can go, and when it turns, these passive and active strategies will quickly reverse recent flows."" ""The result of recent balance sheet expansion has been the same for asset prices, which have become detached from fundamentals in the short term."" Morgan Stanley forecasts an increase in global GDP growth from 3.0% in 2019 to 3.2% in 2020, while U.S. GDP growth in 2020 will lag, at 1.8%. Partly as a result, they say: ""Our earnings model is telling us that the consensus forecast of 10% [S&P 500] EPS growth in 2020 is likely to miss and actually be closer to 0%."" ﻿ ﻿ The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) recently dipped to its lowest level since Aug. 2018, a bearish indicator for market contrarians. “The developments over the past weeks might support the usual narrative that investors are being complacent, and the idea that we could be in for another equity selloff,” as Hubert de Barochez, markets economist at Capital Economics, warned in a note cited by The Wall Street Journal ﻿ ﻿ . Since its recent low close of 11.75 on Nov. 27, the VIX has risen to 14.61 as of the close on Dec. 5. President Trump's indication that a U.S.-China trade deal may be delayed has put many investors on edge. Looking Ahead ""Our advice is to remain fully invested in global equities, while maintaining a tactical overweight to U.S. long-term Treasury bonds and volatility products as a hedge against the inevitable rise in risk aversion that can happen at any moment,"" Wilson says. Morgan Stanley's base case for the S&P 500 Index is that it will end 2020 at 3,000 ﻿ ﻿ , or 3.8% below the Dec. 5, 2019 close."
How Stock Pickers' Plan to Beat Passive Funds Could Backfire,"Many active fund managers are pursuing a potentially risky strategy to compete with passive funds by shunning diversification and focusing on portfolios of fewer stocks, The Wall Street Journal ﻿ ﻿ reports. They are seeking to differentiate themselves further from the low-cost passive ETFs that have been outperforming a large, and growing, majority of active funds simply by tracking market indexes. Moving towards more concentrated portfolios is an attempt to boost investment returns. However, this strategy seems to have backfired, as the most concentrated actively-managed funds are trailing not only the S&P 500 Index, but also their more diversified peers. Key Takeaways Actively-managed funds with small portfolios are growing in number. Concentration is a strategy to improve performance. However, this is increasing risk and producing worse returns. Significance For Investors The number of actively-managed U.S. stock funds with less than 35 holdings in their portfolios is nearly twice what it was at the beginning of 2009, and their assets under management (AUM) are almost three times as large, ending Oct. 2019 at about $161 billion, per analysis by Morningstar Direct cited by the Journal. These concentrated funds now represent over 9% of actively-managed U.S. stock funds, up from 7.6% at the start of 2009. This percentage has not doubled because the total universe of actively-managed funds has grown. The theory behind concentrated portfolios is that these represent the very best investment ideas identified by their managers. Famed investors such as George Soros , John Paulson , and Warren Buffett are among those who favored this approach. Buffett had this to say, in his 1993 Chairman's Letter ﻿ ﻿: “If you are a know-something investor, able to understand business economics and to find five to ten sensibly-priced companies that possess important long-term competitive advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you. It is apt simply to hurt your results and increase your risk. I cannot understand why an investor of that sort elects to put money into a business that is his 20th favorite rather than simply adding that money to his top choices--the businesses he understands best and that present the least risk, along with the greatest profit potential."" However, over the course of the current bull market, concentrated active funds with less than 35 stocks have produced an aggregate total return that is about 80 percentage points less than that for the S&P 500 Index. Among those holding 20 or fewer stocks, relative performance has been even worse. They have trailed the S&P 500 total return by 133 percentage points over the same period. Some advocates for concentrated portfolios argue that they will do better in market selloffs than more diversified funds. “In the financial crisis you pretty quickly saw that it didn’t matter how many companies you owned, it really mattered how high-quality they were,” as Dan Davidowitz, a portfolio manager at Florida-based Polen Capital, told the Journal. His firm has AUM of almost $33 billion, largely in concentrated portfolios for its clients. However, the same report notes that the results have been less than compelling in recent years. During the financial crisis of 2008, as well as during market pullbacks in 2011 and 2015, concentrated active funds with less than 35 stocks fell less than their more diversified peers, but more than the S&P 500. Amid the 2018 selloffs, they finally dropped by less than their diversified peers, but did worse than the S&P 500 once again. Looking Ahead “I believe it’s inevitable that if you fast forward 10 to 15 years, the bulk of surviving active strategies in developed markets will be high-concentration portfolios,” as Barry Gill, head of equities at UBS Asset Management, told the Journal. Investors who prefer concentrated funds “don’t think bull markets last forever, and they think there will be a time when stock pickers have an advantage,” adds Richard Cook, who oversees about $310 million in AUM at Alabama-based Cook & Bynum Capital Management."
Stocks Hold Against Resistance,"Market Moves Stocks closed slightly lower after last week's rebounding price action. The S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all closed more than one-third of a percent lower, while the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) was lower by only 0.2%, setting up the possibility that opportunistic investors are hanging around and shopping for investment bargains. Market analysts and fund managers are preparing for an update to the Fed's monetary policy later this week (Wednesday). Today's price action likely reflects a reluctance to commit to a particular line of action before then. Absent such news, any retail, at-home trader or investor might wonder how they could be wary of short-term news sellers that might push the market around for their own advantage. There are simply too many market participants and too many cross-currents inherent in their decision making to be able to know with certainty when the market is artificially oversold . That point acknowledged, however, one particular indicator that seems to produce better-than-random results at gauging such moments is known as the Balance of Power indicator. In the chart below, the indicator is applied to the S&P 500 over the past four months. This indicator simply takes the difference between the open and close of the trading session and divides it by the difference between the high and the low of the trading session. (If you think about it enough, you will realize that a tall green candle that opens at its low and closes at its high would register a 1.00 score with this calculation). It is interesting to note that the lowest scores of this indicator turn out to be excellent indications for when the price action is statistically more likely to rebound in a mean-reversion price action over the next week or so. In the chart shown below, the green circles indicate times where entering on the opening price of the next day and holding for at least five days yields a profit, the red circles a loss. Amgen Example: The Balance of Power Indicator A more detailed example of this indicator can be found in the chart below. This chart of Amgen, Inc. ( AMGN ) was generated from Investopedia's own charts that open when an in-line ticker symbol is clicked on by a reader. When these charts are open, the Balance of Power indicator can be applied. Any time this indicator dips below a -0.7 reading, it may be an indication that a little more selling than buying has taken place and the price may have pushed a little too low in a short-term duration. The chart below registers all the times this has occurred on Amgen over the past year. The green arrows represent times where buying the opening price of the next day and holding for five days results in a profitable trade. The red arrows represent the incidents where such a trade resulted in a loss. This particular signal is potentially useful for those looking for prices that pushed lower, for whatever reason, in a potentially artificially motivated price action.

Charles Schwab Stock: A Top Pick for 2020 Canopy Growth Corporation Moving Higher Traders and investors interested in opportunities to find growth in the cannabis industry have been disappointed for most of the past year. Today's price action marked the most significant rise in the past six months. It is likely to be too early to declare the bear market in cannabis stocks over, but it marks a moment worth noting. The move in Canopy Growth Corporation ( CGC ), shown in the chart below, may have professional investors putting the industry back on their radar screens. The Bottom Line Stocks fell back from previous resistance as the market timidly awaits a Fed announcement later this week. Looking at the S&P 500 index and other stocks through the lens of the Balance of Power indicator may prove useful for identifying unnecessarily oversold stocks in this environment. Meanwhile, Canopy Growth Corporation, a major cannabis industry player, showed its first strong movement in six months. Enjoy this article? Get more by signing up for the Chart Advisor newsletter."
Buying in Health Care Stocks Is Extreme,"Art confuses me. Complex drawings sell for fifty bucks, and blank canvases for tens of thousands. Case in point: at Art Basel in Miami last week, a banana duct-taped to the wall sold for $120,000. Artist Maurizio Cattelan's work ""forces us to question how value is placed on material goods,"" according to the gallery owner. But the value literally went down the hatch when another performance artist ate what was likely history's most expensive banana. Cattelan was about to head to the airport when he heard about the banana's tragic end. Someone offered him a banana to cheer him up. Maurizio is the guy who made a $6 million 18-karat gold toilet. The loo was stolen from an English Palace last summer. Cattelan seems unlucky, as does the buyer of the $120,000 banana. You can’t make this stuff up! Oh well … I find art tough because it's purely subjective. I know there are experts who can ""accurately"" value works of art: I have an art broker in the family. But when things are based on emotion, it seems virtually impossible to predict their value. Emotions are as unique as the individual. So why invest based on emotion or another investor's sentiment? Isn't the science of investing all about predicting future value accurately? Why do we hear about what traders feel in the market? I tried trading on my instinct for a month trading the USD/GBP currency pair in 2002. I lost 19 out of 21 trades. My boss at the time traded the opposite way and made a killing. It was such a disaster that I stopped trading for years … until I could create a data-based framework for making decisions. For me, data was the way forward. I started winning after basing investments on things like earnings, profits, debt levels, and big institutional buy and sell pressure. Dropping 120 grand for a banana on a wall makes no sense to me. Buying a company with a growing business making tons of money does. I can at least hope to predict its future trajectory. Who could predict the banana's value? I guess we could have predicted someone would have eaten it. When it comes to the market, all I do is focus on data. It allows us to create a picture going forward. Last week it showed something interesting. The big money buying is slowing down. The next chart just shows net buying to selling. When buying picks up, markets rise (the green arrows). When buying dries up, markets soon fall (red arrows). www.mapsignals.com This makes sense. Big money moving in and out of markets logically has an impact. The Big Money Index (BMI) has been falling. That means buying is slowing. This is after the index went over 75%: that's when it became overheated. I expect the market to pull back, as it can't go straight up forever. Everything needs to take a breath, and when buying becomes unsustainable, there's eventually no one left to buy from. Markets then correct and reset for the next phase of the bull market. Make no mistake – we are in a bull market. I fully expect stocks to continue to rise, but the recent rally is losing steam. As the year winds down, volume typically dries up, which could partially explain it. So does being overheated. I would expect the market to pull back in the coming weeks. We do have the January effect coming, which usually buoys stocks. If I had to guess, I would say that the second half of January or early February should see a market pullback. That just means I wouldn't add risk now. I am waiting for some discounts to appear. When the market goes on sale is the time to add risk. I fully expect the market to continue higher thereafter. We can also see the buying slowing in the sectors. In the past few weeks, we have seen many yellow boxes in the following table. It shows total buying and selling on a sector level. The yellow is when more than 25% of the sector's stocks see buy/sell signals in a week. www.mapsignals.com Last week, we saw only one: a continuation of the health care buying frenzy. I alerted you to when it began weeks ago. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLV ) has rallied nearly 8% since. www.mapsignals.com I expect health care to take a pause and pull back as well. This level of buying has become unsustainable, and the sector is now overbought . The light blue line shows the moving average of buying over 25 days. When it peaks above 10, the red line, health care is overbought. We expect a correction sometime thereafter. This level of buying is unprecedented, indicating that the presidential candidates are not posing a risk to health care. www.mapsignals.com I'm not being an alarmist here. I am bullish on the market. Only now things are overheated, and I suspect that the market needs to vent. I believe it will happen in the coming weeks. The data says so. Using data to invest makes sense, but spending $120,000 on bananas doesn't. Sometimes markets don't make sense. Data helps us make sense of them. And sometimes a banana is just a banana. The Bottom Line We (Mapsignals) continue to be bullish on U.S. equities in the long term, and we see any pullback as a buying opportunity. Weak markets can offer sales on stocks if an investor is patient. Disclosure: The author holds no positions in any stocks mentioned at the time of publication. Investment Research Disclaimer"
Equilibrium Found,"Market Moves Stocks closed nearly unchanged today in all major indexes. Large cap indexes including the S&P 500 ( SPX ), the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJX ) all closed just slightly below unchanged, while the Russell 2000 ( RUT ) and the Russell Microcap index ( RUMIC ) were slightly above unchanged. The market's lethargy isn't terribly surprising considering the pending Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement release tomorrow from Fed officials. It is worth recalling that this statement, copied, pasted, and modified after each meeting, is the primary tool the FOMC uses to communicate with investors about its monetary policy outlook. The statement contains the outcome of committee members' votes on interest rates and other policy measures. It also provides commentary about the economic conditions that influenced their votes. It is likely this commentary that the market appears to be collectively holding its breath for. The chart below shows the comparison of Fed Funds Rate futures pricing over the past two months. In the two cases where the FOMC issued a statement, the market's reactions were very different. After the late September statement, markets almost immediately began pricing in the next rate cut (as prices drifted higher throughout the following month). Since the late October meeting, however, the price has held concretely where it began, reflecting a resolute expectation that the Fed Funds will not change rates. This equilibrium of expectations has reached an equilibrium of prices in the market leading up to tomorrow's statement. Under such circumstances, it is only natural to look for signals the market might be giving about where investors will take prices after an announcement they already fully anticipate. Analyzing a Bearish Signal on the Market Indexes The chart below shows a curious signal that shows up in analyzing a combination of price action and volume statistics. The chart features State Street's S&P 500 index tracking ETF ( SPY ) with a technical study known as the Money Flow Index (MFI). This index calculates above average moves up (or down) and weights them according to the volume traded for the day. The calculation shows a surprisingly bearish divergence on the chart below. The indicator shows that volume in selling is more significant when applied to down moves than up moves over the past two weeks. As the price of the S&P 500 pushes against new highs, this indication actually breaks new lows. Similar analyses on the Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average look even worse. This short-term indication points out that markets are more likely to go lower than higher. Micro-Cap Stocks Showing Resilience If the markets were setting up to see prices drop, then well-informed investors would be preparing to protect themselves from such a fall. Historically speaking, investors have typically met such moments by pulling away from investments with greater risk. Based on the chart below, that is not the situation we are in at this moment in time. The chart below shows the same MFI indicator applied to iShares' Russell Microcap Index tracking ETF ( IWC ). This index, tracking many of the riskiest stocks in the market, shows that investors are seeking opportunity rather than fleeing from it. This could hardly do more to solidify the notion that investors find the market securely at equilibrium at this moment and are largely uncertain where to go next. Many analysts will be looking to the FOMC statement tomorrow to formulate an opinion about where the market can be expected to go. The Bottom Line Stocks held close to their previous closes as the markets held on to given values in the hours leading up to the release of the FOMC statement tomorrow. While some bearish indications appear on the S&P 500 and other large-cap indexes, the small-cap indexes show signs of investor enthusiasm.
